during press Q &amp; A :  
Trump also praised himself, claiming that his top health expert Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said “innumerous times we’ve saved thousands of lives because of the quick [border] closing.”  
.  
Fauci testified before a House subcommittee on Thursday that the ongoing shortfall of coronavirus testing in the U.S. was “a failing.” The “idea of anybody getting it [testing] easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we’re not set up for that. Do I think we should be? Yes.”  
..  
When another reporter asked Trump on Friday if he took responsibility for that “failing,”  
**he [Trump] responded: “Yeah, no, I don’t take any responsibility at all.” **

It's hard to spin a live broadcast. Trump is dumb, mostly uninformed, and dreams up his truth on the spot. Trump's entire motivation is to protect his own fragile ego. 

The smartest move he's made is the keep Birx and Fauci in their roles; which is ironic considering how often their facts undermine his _gut instincts_.

Experts say that COVID-19 deaths are likely not being overinflated. That list includes by Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is leading the U.S. response to the coronavirus.

19,trump,"&gt;Adding Staff: As he has in each of his budgets, Trump called for a hiring surge at the Homeland Security Department. Customs and Border Protection’s request for 750 Border Patrol Agents, 600 customs and officers and 300 border processing coordinators fell roughly in line with previous asks, though that could prove difficult as Border Patrol netted just 112 new agents last year. DHS was much more aggressive in its request for Immigration and Customs and Enforcement, asking for more than 4,000 new agents and support staff. The agency requested funding for 2,000 agents in fiscal 2019 and just 1,000 in fiscal 2020, goals Congress has largely blocked it from meeting. 

&gt;Subtracting Staff: The Internal Revenue Service proposed slashing its rolls by more than 1,500 employees, despite requesting an overall budget increase of $528 million. The agency said it would fill critical vacancies only and reduce the number of support positions as it allocates funding for pay increases and other personnel costs. It said new funding would go toward boosting customer service and continuing to implement tax reforms Trump signed into law in 2017.

&gt;De-federalizing Disaster Preparation: Trump called on state and local entities to fund their own training for disaster preparedness, suggesting the Federal Emergency Management Agency slash $535 million for continuous training grants. 

&gt;De-federalizing Electricity: As he did in his government reorganization proposal, the president called on the Energy Department to sell off federal utilities such as the Southwestern Power Administration, Western Area Power Administration and Bonneville Power Administration. The administration previously said offloading all federal transmission entities would save $9.5 billion and enable “a more efficient allocation of economic resources.”

22,trump,"Several.

I am for raising the age of social security. The fund is currently not on a solvent future.  When it was enacted, lifespans were a lot shorter than now.  Raise the age to 68, 69 or 70, while keeping the early retirement options.  Most other facets of social security - I am liberal to progressive on.

Foreign policy and militarily, I align closely with a neoconservative.  America has brought about the greatest era of peace in human history since WWII.  deaths per capita to war are at an all time low.  Major and minor powers alike are rarely willing to get into it with their neighbors.  I am for american intervention to overthrow authoritarian states that oppress human rights.  I am for most military spending.  I am pro-sanctions (i think we fail to use them nearly as much as we should.  the one exception is Cuba).

One controversial issue:  i think businesses should be allowed (in non-healthcare) to deny business or employment on gender/race/religion.  Free speech gives the right to even hateful speech.  The public then has the moral necessity to boycott such businesses - (and they shouldn't be able to get government spending of any sort).  Freedom of speech needs to be protected for business individuals though - let them pay the economic price.

I am for limited immigration and border security (note - Trump is a giant racist asshole on how he goes about the Wall).  I think the crackdown on illegal aliens needs to come down hard on the employers.  Illegal aliens won't be here if they don't have a job.  At the same time, i recognize DACA and the need for it.",1,1583203604

Identity politics didn't work in 2016, they don't work now. 



Liz is as progressive as Bloom is a democrat (he's not). That's why she lost, people saw through the bullshit. There was a poll about most favorable senators and she landed in the bottom 10-15, but that's just sexism right? She came in 3rd in her own state? I guess Mass is full of sexists (there's a good Boston joke in there somewhere). 


&gt;Think back to Hillary Clinton, who after a lifetime of being bludgeoned and battered by every sexist preconception, trope and backlash, finally got within reach of the ultimate reward and opportunity only to have to face her exact opposite, an utterly unprepared buffoon and raging misogynist


If you listen to main stream media, Hillary lost because of sexist, racist, Russian trolls, but let's be real, she ran a garbage campaign ""Not Trump"" doesn't inspire anyone. Business as usual doesn't inspire anyone. Cozying up to Wall Street, big business, the military industrial complex doesn't inspire anyone. 
 



&gt;Let’s consider that Joe Biden is the likeliest candidate to be the Democratic nominee, despite the fact that he has run an absolutely abysmal campaign and is so erratic that sympathetic Democrats regularly tell one another, “I saw Biden give an interview, and he was completely coherent!” as though they were praising a toddler. Biden won a sweeping victory on Super Tuesday even in states where he did not campaign for a single day or have an organization. There has never in my lifetime been a winning presidential campaign that was so weak on so many dimensions.


This is probably the best point the whole article makes. Is Biden really electable? Sure as hell isn't.

Shes accepting Billionaire/Super Pac money


Shes held meetings with investment bankers and big money donors


She earned hundreds of thousands of dollars on the side advising (among others) chemical companies, oil companies, banks, and insurers on how to navigate bankruptcy proceedings.


She has no real plan to actually pass M4A, by evidence on her transition plan 



Her foreign policy is absolute shit:

Defends military aid to Israel, furthermore calling Operation Protective Edge ""Israel's right to defend itself"" - that operation killed thousands of Palestinians. 


Check what she's said about Bolivia &amp; Venezuela. 


Trump hasn't been aggressive enough in North Korea according to Warren,



""Climate change is real, it’s worsening by the day, and it’s undermining our military readiness."" And “Our military can help lead the fight in combating climate change.” are quotes from Warren... Let's shoot global warming. But seriously, the military industrial complex is a huge reason for climate change, not only the massive amount of fossil fuels if takes to power our tanks and jets, but taking away funds that can go towards fighting climate change.

&gt;Look at the timeline for Donald Trump's comments on the coronavirus. He  has yet to give an accurate account of the issue and it wasn't until  halfway through march that he began to address the issue as a potential  problem. 

Although Donald Trump ran as a Republican he isn't a personification of the ideology or of what people think.  


&gt; Think about the guy that drank aquarium cleaner. He did so after  watching the false information being peddled during the presidential  addresses. 

 You dont really belive this do you? The 3+ people that drank it are morons and quite frankly I don't feel any sympathy for them and what they drank was ***Chloroquine*** NOT **Hydroxychloroquine** which was what Donald Trump said, and it is the equivalent of drinking bleach. For much as I hate Fox news CNN has stepped to their level saying crap like that. Almost normalizing drinking chemicals without prescription.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; If any of those people are out there because they think the issue of the  coronavirus is being played up, then the right wing media is directly  to blame for colluding with the President's messaging 

I think its more the other way around, What SOME people on the right (and china) are concerned about is the halting economy that will probably ruin them (they haven't gotten the memo that it already did) so they want people working and buying and Clogged hospitals aren't a big issue and old people dying are actually good for the economy. Fox news is backed by these people that simple, if you go look at early footage both Fox and CNN/MSNBC said pretty much the same. And fox news also recently fired a reporter for downplaying covid19. Trump is scientifically illiterate so he goes with the flow. There's no collusion just ignorance.",1,1585870729
170,trump,"Unfortunately our media makes this impossible. All the Congress can do is refuse to pass legislation. If  they did that Trump would go on TV 24/7 accusing them of hurting the American People.

 And the News media would show ever speech live and bring in three pundits to disduss.one would be a democrat and Congress was trying to restore the system of shared power and checks and balances. One would be a Trumpist and say that they were trying to stage a Communist revolution against our wise, decisive, and highly intelligent president who is working to save America. Then the third pundit would be a center right both/siderism plutocrat who would say that now is not the time to have this debate (It's never the time to have any debate for the centrist as their entire livelihood is invested in the status quo). 

So the viewer gets a 30 minute Trump speech calling Democrats traitors and 10 minutes of pundits talking in which the Democrat gets 3 minutes to try to talk about nuanced constitutional issues that bores about 75 percent of the population to death while the Trunoist flings insults like a guest on a Jerry Springer episode.

---

Just a month ago Donald Trump was still insisting that Covid-19 was a trivial issue, comparing it to the “common flu.” And he dismissed economic concerns; after all, during flu season, “nothing is shut down, life &amp; the economy go on.”

But pandemics come at you fast. Since Trump’s blithe dismissal, something like 15 million Americans have lost their jobs — the economic implosion is happening so quickly that official statistics can’t keep up.

In our last economic crisis the economy shrank around 6 percent relative to its long-run trend, and the unemployment rate rose around five percentage points. At a guess, we’re now looking at a slump three to five times that deep.

And this plunge isn’t just quantitatively off the charts; it’s qualitatively different from anything we’ve seen before. Normal recessions happen when people choose to cut spending, with the unintended consequence of destroying jobs. So far this slump mainly reflects the deliberate, necessary shutdown of activities that increase the rate of infection.

As I’ve been saying, it’s the economic equivalent of a medically induced coma, in which some brain functions are temporarily shut down to give the patient a chance to heal.

Paul Krugman’s Newsletter: Get a better understanding of the economy — and an even deeper look at what’s on Paul’s mind.

While a deep slump is unavoidable, however, good policies could do a lot to minimize the amount of hardship Americans experience. The problem is that the U.S. political landscape has long been dominated by an anti-government ideology that left us unprepared, intellectually and institutionally, for this crisis.

What should we be doing? Serious economists have already reached a rough consensus over the appropriate policy response to a pandemic. The bottom line is that this isn’t a conventional recession, which calls for broad-based economic stimulus. The immediate mission, beyond an all-out effort to contain the pandemic itself, should instead be disaster relief: generous aid to those suffering a sudden loss of income as a result of the economy’s lockdown.

It’s true that we could suffer a second round of job losses if the victims of the lockdown slash spending on other goods and services. But adequate disaster relief would address this problem, too, helping to sustain demand.

So it’s all about helping the economic victims of the coronavirus lockdown. How are we doing?

The good news is that thanks to Democratic pressure, the CARES Act, the $2 trillion not-a-stimulus bill that became law less than three weeks after Trump dismissed the notion that Covid-19 might pose an economic problem, is mostly focused on the right things. The core provisions of the legislation are aid to hospitals, the unemployed and small businesses that maintain their payrolls; these are exactly the kinds of things we should be doing.

What’s especially remarkable is that we got mostly sensible legislation even though the president was talking nonsense, pushing for — what else? — tax cuts as the solution for the economy’s problems. Actually, I can’t think of any other recent example in which Republicans agreed to major fiscal legislation that mainly involved spending to benefit the needy, without any tax cuts for the rich.

The bad news comes in two parts.

First, the bill falls far short of what’s needed on one crucial dimension: aid to state governments, which are on the front line of dealing with the pandemic. Unlike the federal government, states have to balance their budgets each year. Now they’re facing a surge in costs and huge revenue losses; unless they get a lot more aid, they’ll be forced to cut spending sharply, which will directly undermine essential services and indirectly deepen the overall slump.

And it’s not clear when or whether that hole will be filled. Senate Republicans are hostile to the idea of another rescue package; White House officials are reportedly still talking about tax cuts.

Second, decades of hostility to government have left us poorly positioned to deliver even the aid Congress has voted. State unemployment offices have been underfunded for a long time, and red states have deliberately made it hard to apply for benefits. So the surge in unemployment is overwhelming the benefits system; Congress may have voted disaster relief, but the money isn’t flowing.

The loan program for small businesses is also, by all accounts, off to a shambolic start. And those $1,200 checks everyone is supposed to get? Many Americans won’t get them for weeks or months.

It doesn’t have to be like this. Canada has already set up a special web portal and phone system to provide emergency unemployment benefits. Germans have been pleasantly surprised by how quickly aid is flowing to the self-employed and small businesses.

But decades of conservative attacks on the idea that government can do anything good have left America with a unique case of learned helplessness. And this is combined with utter lack of leadership from the top.

We know what we should be doing in terms of economic policy, and Congress passed a relief bill that, while flawed, was better than I expected. But right now it looks as if our response to the economic emergency will fall far short.",1,1586275397

331,trump,"Sorry but the Left is overreacting on this, as are the dummies who tried taking the shit, of course. Consider, for example, that there is a well-known disinfection procedure for drinking water that involves using bleach with water to render it safe to *drink*. From the Internet:

&gt; **Use** the table below as a guide to decide the amount of **bleach** you should add to the **water**, for example, 8 drops of 6% **bleach**, or 6 drops of 8.25% **bleach**, to each gallon of **water**. Double the amount of **bleach** if the **water** is cloudy, colored, or very cold. Stir and let stand for 30 minutes.Sep 7, 2017 

Obviously, it can be ingested. This is not taken to be a treatment. It is not hard, however, to imagine that trace amounts of bleach could be introduced to the body (key word: trace) that might have some mitigating effect on something without killing the person. OR NOT. I realize the OR NOT part. 

The Left wants to make too much hay out of this speculation on Trump's part. The reason I appear to be ""defending"" him is because *making hay the wrong way will lose the day!* And it's what they've been doing far too much. Not only that, I actually do think that there needs to be greater emphasis placed on the preliminary/speculative phase of developing new science. Yes, Trump should have been more careful and presidential. Yes, he should have said, ""from one dummy to a whole bunch of them out there, don't try this at home"", but he did refer/defer this to the medical experts. That the might actually just run and start researching that is utterly laughable, of course. But that's not quite the same malfeasance as what people are trying to make this out to be. 

What if the government set up a web site: Corona Ideas? ""We want your ideas! Maybe one out of a thousand is a great one, but that's how you get them. Please, send your ideas, whether it's for a better kind of mask, an avenue for research, a policy change, etc., and we'll collate and organize them, making sure not to lose the good ones. Your ideas matter!"" Something like that. It's better than the government saying either ""Well we just don't know!"" or ""These are the steps we encourage (while sidestepping some question)"" or even ""Drugs are bad, mkay?""

The cutting-through-the-bullshit factor does work on the Right as well as on the Left. That the Right is a thousand times more full of shit than the Left is beside the point here. The Right has succeeded in large part because of what is forgotten when the Left fastens on this or that gaffe, this or that blunder, this or that error, etc., while the Right still has some smoldering ember of a point. Hey, the war in Iraq, that was *all about oil*, right? Yeah, how well did that hay-making work?",-5,1588186577

334,trump,"Here are thoughts on sarcasmgate I jotted a couple of days ago:

""Sarcasm"" as cherry picking.

Trump, the cherry picker in chief, cherry picks the term ""sarcasm"" to denote speaking in anything other than a straightforward way in the manner of a pure statement of truth. There is a relationship between the sarcastic and the mode of speech he was using when he was talking about disinfectants and light as possible treatments. Both are in some form of remove from a simple, straightforward statement. To his credit (not that much is due here), he was not simply recommending injecting bleach or that light could simply be beamed into the body.

But the issue is how he glommed onto the idea of ""sarcasm"" here. He went after a kind of nearby (to him) sense/definition and fixated on it, which can be seen as a kind of cherry picking. He cherry picked the concept of sarcasm, which had associated benefits that were attractive to him. It portrays him (if he were being sarcastic) as intellectually superior and defending himself in a mode of contempt.

This is similar, in a way, to the way the anti-war Left glommed on to the idea of the ""lie"" as regards the matter of UN inspections for WMDs in Iraq before the invasion of Iraq. Leaving aside the part that was actually a lie (to whatever degree that was the case), the fact is the possible was indeed a factor in the equation. The lie and the possible are both at a remove in some way from a more straightforward matter of fact.

It's interesting that both cases (Trump and the antiwar movement) pertain to a more neutral matter of possibility. Both forced this kind of possibilizing speech/thought/awareness into a more arched form (sarcasm or the lie as such). Neither is very interested in clarifying the matter of the merely possible and various modes of possibilizing, such as brainstorming (which is really what Trump was doing, in a kind of standard speculating around the business meeting table mode) and being fearful of the future (we can't prove what hasn't happened yet and based on Saddam's history, a case could be made at that time that he could be harboring WMDs, might use them, had used some on his own people in the past, etc.)

What, exactly, is cherry picked when possibilizing is converted into ""sarcasm"" or ""lies""? The concepts (if that's what they are) of sarcasm and lying. When the term is put into use/fixated upon, it obtains precisely because of the nature of mixed meaning in language. Someone being sarcastic is saying something that is in one sense possible, although they are using it in a kind of counter-possible and counter-factual way. Someone lying is saying something that is in some sense possible (but false).

Cherry picking always involves a range of spectrum. Something within that range or spectrum is picked and made to stand centrally, while other parts of the range are left in the background. Generally, Republicans cherry pick more than Democrats, although as per my examples, they both do it. In situations of heightened passion (greed or fear, capitalism or war), cherry picking takes many forms. In greed, a particular business deal is deemed ""best"" because of some personal advantage it offers. In fear, looming dangers are fastened upon as being imminent. In capitalism, profits are projected with a certain prejudice while ignoring information to the contrary. In war, targets may be attacked without due determination (""take the shot!""). Etc.

The question is why the basic operation (which I'm calling cherry picking) doesn't come into relief as well as it could. The term is used a lot of late, for obvious reasons, and again owing more to the Right than the Left. Obamacare was a good example of legislation that, in some ways at least, systematically refused to cherry pick (include preexisting conditions) or allow it (no junk insurance).

But what does it mean for Trump to be excoriated for 1) ""recommending injecting oneself with bleach"" (he didn't) and 2) deeming his own possibilizing in a cherry picked form (as ""sarcasm"", which it clearly was not)? The problem is that there is a truth on Trump's side that leads to a person, a kind of generalized person who, in due form, is cherry picked as ""the forgotten"". Most of the strident, rebellious terms/charicatures/gestures Trump and his ilk use characterize and simply flesh out their positions are, interestingly, drawn from a Left leaning language and resistance, and, especially, inclusion. So the ""forgotten person"" Trump claimed to defend, and those who cast themselves in that light, was precisely someone who was, presumably, left on the margins within the range/spectra out of which some other, more ""important"" figure/population/etc. was cherry picked. To be sure, the Left was cherry picking less and were, as in the case of Obamacare, working precisely not to forget, to leave in the background of a range of possibilities, various individuals (with preexisting conditions, low incomes, etc.) That Trump and Company were able to leverage the logic of anti-cherry-picking into their MO itself was an act of supreme cherry picking. Indeed, this is Trumps ""genius"". And it may be a bit of genius, really. Formidable.

When the Left cherry picks (as lies, as false sarcasm), unfortunately, they leave something in the background. And that something then goes on to fuel the cherry picking on the Right as they Right proceeds to do their own cherry-picked anti-cherry-picking. If I appear to defend Trump here, I risk excoriation by the Left for not fixating on his own self-characterization as ""sarcasm"" and for not accusing him (falsely) of literally recommending self-injection with bleach. Then I become one of ""the forgotten"" (in this case, on the Left). Which, interestingly enough, I actually am; I was highly critical of the anti-war movement for its cherry picking the idea of ""no war for oil"" (it was far more than that), to the point of my moving into a different kind of, post-Left Leftism, in a manner of speaking. The issue here is that when we cherry pick, there is truth in the remainder, and out of that emerges one thing or another. On the Right, well, we know what happens there. On the Left, there are many varieties of post-Leftism, some good, maybe some not so good. In any case, however, part of the source of cherry picking lies in the very combative structure of ""Left versus Right"". This structure leads to an ongoing, motivated cherry picking ""on both sides"" indeed, but for essential reasons there is more on the Right. But there is more than enough, that is to say, too much, on the Left. Which is why the anti-war movement failed so spectacularly, and which is why, I would suggest, Trump got into power in the first place.

Look closely (if you dare) at Trumps own characterization of his relation to the press in this whole affair. He isn't just trying to slink way from the press by calling his language ""sarcasm"", even if he doesn't really know what sarcasm is, at least not fully, which appears to be the case. His later, ""Noble"" comments add to this strange phenomenon. You're making a mistake if you want to cherry pick his behavior and thinking here as simple, guilty stupidity. He is, in part, waving a red cape before what he takes to be a bull. He's happy to get the idea of sarcasm wrong here; he doesn't care. He's more playing the remove, that distance I mentioned above, from a more straightforward truth that occurs in sarcasm, lying and other things. You could say that, in the throes of the chaos, the excoriation, etc., he is still, in part, getting jiggy with it. He is. And what's worse, he's partly right. He has a ""foot in the truth"", just as the Bush administration did in their justifications for war.

Only thought can help illuminate this general problematic. A new Leftism must involve a new emphasis on thought. Or you can go back to cherry picking, albeit doing it less, and playing right into the hands of the Right. Every red line you draw is a white line within which the Right drives at full speed.",-1,1588187935

---

Almost a decade has passed since I published a column, “Myths of Austerity,” warning that deficit alarmism would delay recovery from the Great Recession — which it did. Unfortunately, that kind of alarmism seems to be making a comeback.

You can see that comeback in the gradually increasing number of news analyses emphasizing how much debt we’ll run up dealing with the Covid-19 crisis. You can also see it in the rhetoric of politicians like Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, who is blocking aid to beleaguered state and local governments because, he says, it would cost too much.

So this seems like a good time to emphasize two key facts. One is economic: While we will run very big budget deficits over the next couple of years, they will do little if any harm. The other is that whatever they may say, very few prominent figures in politics or the media are genuine deficit hawks, who are actually worried about the consequences of rising government debt. What we mainly have, instead, are deficit peacocks and deficit vultures.

The term “deficit peacocks” was coined by the Center for American Progress for people who preen and posture about fighting deficits without offering realistic policy proposals. I’d broaden the term to include what I used to call Very Serious People — those who inveigh against the evils of debt not because they’ve done a careful analysis but because they imagine that it makes them sound earnest and tough-minded.

The glory days of deficit peacocks were the early teens, an era in which people like Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles were lionized by the news media. As Vox’s Ezra Klein noted at the time, for some reason “the usual rules of reportorial neutrality don’t apply when it comes to the deficit”; the wisdom and virtue of deficit warriors were simply taken for granted.

We haven’t heard much from the deficit peacocks in recent years, even though the budget deficit, which declined sharply during the Obama years, soared again under Donald Trump. Funny how that works. But you can be sure they’ll be back in force if Joe Biden wins this November.

What about deficit vultures? That’s the term I’ve been using for politicians who exploit real or imagined fiscal distress to feed a reactionary policy agenda.

After the last crisis, conservatives used deficits as an excuse to cut social programs — for example, a number of states made it much harder to collect unemployment benefits. This time around, McConnell and Trump are trying to exploit deficit fears to force state governments to downsize, undermine (and possibly privatize) the post office and more.

It goes almost without saying that the deficit vultures are hypocrites. After all, Trump and McConnell rammed through a $2 trillion tax cut in 2017, with no apparent concern about the effects on the deficit. Nor have I heard any Republican complaints about Trump’s huge bailouts for farmers, whose distress is largely the result of his own policies.

An aside: Far too much reporting on these issues involves what the economist Dean Baker calls mind-reading. That is, news analyses include statements along the lines of “Republicans are concerned about rising deficits,” when in fact all we know is that Republicans claim to be concerned about rising deficits — and there are very good reasons to be skeptical about that claim. After all, have modern Republicans ever seen deficits as a constraint on their own tax-cutting agenda? Even once?

Still, hypocrisy aside, should we be worried about the effects of Covid-19 on debt? No.

It’s true that we’re headed for some eye-popping numbers. Last week the Congressional Budget Office released preliminary economic and budget projections for the next two years, which were both shocking and unsurprising.

That is, the numbers were grim but more or less in line with what many independent economists have been predicting. In particular, the budget office expects the Covid-19 crisis to drive the unemployment rate to 16 percent in a few months, which might even be on the low side.

Soaring unemployment will cause federal revenues to plunge, and also lead to a surge in spending on safety-net programs like unemployment insurance, Medicaid and food stamps. Add in the large relief packages Congress has passed, and the budget office projects a deficit that will temporarily rise to levels we haven’t seen since World War II, and it expects federal debt to rise to 108 percent from 79 percent of G.D.P., which sounds scary.

But the government will be able to borrow that money at incredibly low interest rates. In fact, real interest rates — rates on government bonds protected against inflation — are negative. So the burden of the additional debt as measured by the rise in federal interest payments will be negligible. And no, we don’t have to worry about paying off the debt; we never will, and that’s OK.

The bottom line is that right now, the only thing we have to fear from deficits is deficit fear itself. Pay no attention to the peacocks and vultures: In this time of pandemic, we can and should spend whatever it takes to limit the damage.",1,1588188881

That being said, he _didn't_ actually say ""you should inject bleach.""  He said disinfectant kills the virus, and _wondered aloud_ whether this could somehow be used by doctors to treat the disease.  It's a legitimate question - if you're a six-year-old hearing about coronavirus for the first time.

I feel it is important for Trump opponents (like myself) to stick to the facts.  The truth is on our side, so we don't have to exaggerate or lie to make our point.

We should say: ""Trump wondered, on camera, if disinfectant or UV light inside the lungs could be used to treat coronavirus.  This had the result, which any reasonable person could have predicted, of vulnerable or ill-educated TV viewers poisoning themselves.  Trump's actions were negligent and dangerous.""

We should not say: ""Trump told us to inject bleach.""  This lets him, and his supporters, off the hook much too easily.  They can just object, rightly, that he did _not_ say that.

\[Bill Bryan did not mention anything about shining ultra violet light into  people, or anything remotely usable in the human body.  
Bill Bryan: (24:22)  
...our most striking observation to date is the powerful effect that solar light appears to have on killing the virus, both surfaces and in the air...   


Bill Bryan: (28:34)  
...We’re also testing disinfectants readily available. We’ve tested bleach, we’ve tested isopropyl alcohol on the virus specifically in saliva or in respiratory fluids and I can tell you that bleach will kill the virus in five minutes... ...We’re also looking at other disinfectants...  


Donald Trump: (29:46)  
\[00:29:46\] a question that probably some of you are thinking of if you’re totally into that world, which I find to be very interesting. So, supposedly when we hit the body with a tremendous, whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light, and I think you said that hasn’t been checked, but you’re going to test it. And then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. And I think you said you’re going to test that too. Sounds interesting, right? And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it’d be interesting to check that so that you’re going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me.

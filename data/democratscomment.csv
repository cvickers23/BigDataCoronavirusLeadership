This is not the first coronavirus threat in the United States, and it will not be the last,” said Senator Markey. “With three novel coronavirus outbreaks in the last 18 years, finding a vaccine that treats all coronaviruses would be a milestone for global health and safety. We have the best scientists and researchers on the planet, and the United States should lead the world in containing this crisis and preventing future ones. By providing dedicated, consistent resources, we can perform the basic scientific research necessary to develop a universal coronavirus vaccine that prevents the next novel biothreat. That goal is within our grasp.”

A copy of the legislation can be found here. 

On February 3, Senators Markey queried the NIAID about its efforts to design and produce a universal coronavirus vaccine. NIAID administrator Dr. Anthony Fauci previously said of the current outbreak that a universal coronavirus vaccine is possible and worth considering.

And in December 2019, Senator Markey secured $200 million in funding in the year-end spending package for research for the creation of a universal influenza vaccine that could protect against multiple strains of the flu virus and offer longer lasting protection.",1,1583738838

All you can do is pay attention to Governors, Dr. Redfield, and Dr. Fauci to make sure the money is getting there which takes some time. Everyone has been dumping on the testing cause it sucked.

This administration would have never thought to make Barack Obama head if a committee and point man on the project.  Ron Klain?  Nope.  He knows what he's doing.

Trump: “A lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat—as the heat comes in.”

February 24: 

Trump: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. . . . Stock Market starting to look very good to me.”

February 27:

Trump: “It’s going to disappear one day, it’s like a miracle.” 

February 28:

Eric Trump: “In my opinion, it’s a great time to buy stocks or into your 401k. I would be all in . . . let’s see if I’m right.”

March 2:

Trump on a coronavirus vaccine: “I’ve heard very quick numbers, that of months.” (Immunologist Anthony Fauci, has repeatedly said that a vaccine will not be available for a year or 1 1/2 years.)

March 6:

Trump: ""Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”

Trump: “I didn’t know people died from the flu.” (His own grandfather died from the flu.)

Trump on whether or not to bring coronavirus patients on a cruise ship to shore: “I like the numbers being where they are.”

March 10:

Trump: “It will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.”

8,fauci,"Trump and his team of lackeys are hoping ppl forgot about that. One or two news cycles should be enough to cover their incompetence or they were hoping it would. Ya know, when trump called the State Dept the deep state and Fauci covered his face, that would have been a good time for Fauci to speak up and say ENOUGH!!",1,1584766321

We wouldn’t have a president yelling at the press and we wouldn’t be scared when Dr. fauci missed a press call for fear that he was fired for disagreeing with trump.  

We can’t ever know for certain, but I can guarantee things would be better.",1,1584938156

15,fauci,I usually mute trump but listen to Fauci and Brix. Trump’s patting himself ad nauseum takes precious time from the experts. Where is the short term and long term plan? This is a marathon and we’re stumbling to get the first mile. He needs to step aside.,1,1585696984
16,fauci,She’s gotta twist a few arms and sugar coat others. But got it done quickly in political time. Trump needs oversight for his inept handling of this crisis. He makes two blunders for every one he gets right (by finally listening to Fauci etc). And WTF are we diverting resources (military) to wage another war on drugs. Or not renewing Obamacare? Putin must be proud of his star pupil.,1,1585854565
17,fauci,"History will be the ultimate judge, and I'm betting it's not going to be nice about it.  So much could've been done sooner to slow this thing down.  Closing the country off from foreign travelers faster, telling everyone to wear masks 6 weeks ago, and telling governors to lock down sooner, mandatory quarantines for all those people coming into the US, especially on the cruises.  This thing is spread through people's breath, so if we ALL cover up this will help prevent it from spreading.  If one infected person is on a train or bus and coughs or even breaths heavily they're putting that crap in the air and on every surface near them.  Anyone else comes in an touches then wipes face or mouth they now have it ... that's why I think it's going so crazy in NYC and other places with public transportation.  A bus driver in NYC videoed someone coughing on his bus, and the driver died weeks later after having it.  The thing is you can find science reports from months ago covering all this ... this administration fired most of the scientists in the cabinet and put his friends and financial backers into the positions.  They're not listening to the science.  How many times has Dr Fauci contradicted Trump, even to the point where Trump cuts him off.  It's sad how anyone can think Washington has played this thing well. 

The only way out of this is to tell everyone nation wide, wear masks or face coverings or you will be fined.  And if you are infected you must be quarantined, and I'd love to see large sites for people who would like to be quarantined away from home as to not infect family.  And every vehicle used by public transportation needs to be cleaned very often.  

This is a mess...",1,1586363490
18,fauci,"He also can't stand being wrong.

This is why he tries his level best to not actually do anything. In his mind, if the governors fail to protect their states, that's on them, but if he actually takes charge with the Defense act and so forth, it's on him. Between his narcissism and his fear of being wrong, he's locked up, he's blue screened, he can't bring himself to act.

His fear of being wrong also means we get less air time from folks with actual knowledge (like Fauci) because Trump can't stand it when he says something and Fauci says something else and everyone listens to Fauci.",1,1586546400

20,fauci,"Fortunately Trump understands that if he reopens too early and needs to close down again, that really would lose him reelection.

Also, he probably understands that if he completely ignores Birx and Fauci, they could resign and tell the world that POTUS was winging it.",1,1586564880
21,fauci,"Someone laid out a not so out there conspiracy theory to me. We know China isn't telling the whole truth on numbers. We know the administration knew this as well. What if delaying a response to CONVID-19 was thisu adminstration's way of trying to push out the people on social security so that they could work towards abolishing it.

25,fauci,You think he’s just mad about the criticism of his response time to the pandemic or is it a bigger effort to change the public’s opinion and either remove Fauci bc he needs someone else who will support opening the economy in May or justify silencing him?,3,1586790014
26,fauci,"Trump would do a lot to save the economy since he ran on it. He probably thinks a stronger economy than the one he pissed away is his ticket to a second term and also avoiding much deserved jail time. He will have Fauci removed from any meaningful role once he figures out how to ""rationalize"" it. He is right that people are suffering from the lack of income and the pittance checks are his interim solution. He would rather ""open the economy"" than write another round of those checks.",6,1586795983
27,fauci,"Trump doesn’t like being corrected, and Fauci has had to do so many times. I can imagine Fauci, regardless of his political affiliation, would welcome being fired at this time. Would YOU want to work directly for an incompetent dickwad that constantly threw you under the bus and denied the facts you presented, *especially* during a global pandemic in a country that has it the worst? I’d say “thank fuck!” and then educate the public on the way Trump has actually handled this whole ordeal without the fear of losing my job (spoiler: he’s handled it very poorly).",1,1586797460
28,fauci,"Maybe, but ultimately I just think he’s looking for another scapegoat and his supporters are dumb
enough to buy into this. 

Fauci serving in so many prior administrations will just be used as proof that he’s another “inefficient part of the swamp” and Trump isn’t responsible because he just inherited him from past administrations.",6,1586799219
29,fauci,I honestly think it's a combo of old fashioned envy and anger at the fact that Fauci refuses to lay down and play dead every time Trump gets up to lie.

I figure he's old school, so speaking up would have to follow resignation. I don't like thinking about who Trump would replace him with, though I figure even POTUS understands at least a PhD if not PhD+MD would be needed, so at least Kushner wouldn't take that over.

Fauci is like Mattis: he's doing whatever's necessary to remain one of the very few adults in the room.

I'm sure there are others like them on the D side as well, but the cult of Trump insidious and the Republican party is not what it used to be.

Birx is weird as hell. When she’s not speaking she is constantly fidgeting, her facial expression is in constant flux. She’s odd. However, she is much better when she speaks.

She’s was highly respected by the medical community well before her appointment to the coronavirus task force by Trump and before the AIDS global coordinator Obama appointment.

Her and Fauci both seem to be trying hard to be apolitical, and both do so in their own way.  Brix won’t say trump is wrong directly, she’ll just go up there and say accurate stuff which is at odds with trump.  Fauci, meanwhile, is more willing to go up and say the president must’ve been mistaken.

His voters in 2016 voted more anti-Hillary than they did pro-tRump unfairly due to years of prep in the hate group talk radio, Rupert Murdoch &amp; Sinclair news media and conservative (anything but democrat) shows.  She didn’t have a chance.

The biggest thing Hillary was actually guilty of in 2016, and the DNC as well, was lack of an outreach movement on the ground in many states and areas which were seen as throwing good money after bad.  She and the dnc by extension mainly only looked within their borders while tRump was allowed to lie his ass of and have a huge media and Russian led social media push to promise the moon and not even mean it.  Obama’s biggest failing was that he had the tools to do a lot more of those things he promised in a massive grassroots program that once he was elected he dropped!  That grassroots program, which tRump and the RNC lacks, could have made a massive down party difference that would have given him enough power from the bottom up to have made more of the difference he wanted to do.

Bernie has worked on his grassroots program for years now and with Bernie’s “Not me, US”, slogan he may use it with the bully pulpit to drive changes from the bottom up like Obama could have, but I believe his inexperience and experienced power brokers led him to not utilize it.  Bernie is already utilizing it.  The Russians don’t understand grassroots because grassroots haven’t been in play for many years.  Especially not in a plutocrat/autocratic society like Russia.

However.

What I have believed for the past few years is that the nation is broken, and that brokenness is fatal. Public discourse has broken down, the elections have Schrodinger security -- some of them may be secure and others may not and we don't know which or to what extent but in the morning somebody will have ""won"" - and I have not believed that there is any realistic way to fix us.

I do, though, have to wonder if there could be a way forward -- not making the progress we desperately need on social issues, but hemming up the maw that is opening beneath our democracy. 

I'm probably still set on Bernie or Warren, but I see perhaps a secret wisdom in a Biden/some-moderate-Republican ticket. Call it the ""everybody calm the fuck down"" ticket. It mobilizes for the first time the great sluggish millions who don't participate in the process. Maybe they'll actually go vote for an ""chill out it'll be okay"" ticket.

It *won't* all be okay, not at first, but maybe once Trump is out and we're all playing nice, we can get some ""commonsense"" shit done (like election security, maybe even some level-1 gun control) which will allow us to make real progress on the other important issues.

Bloomberg also shares many flaws that Trump does (racism, sexism, corruption etc.) So he can't really attack Trump with those points without looking like a hypocrite and giving Trump an excuse to waive it all away. Trump was the master of that in the 2016 race.

If you want the most electable candidate in the general, maybe consider Bernie again. If you support progressives like Warren and Pete, you might like his policy, which you can check out on his website. Also, he has a really strong case for beating Trump. This video explains it pretty well. https://youtu.be/1PjNlBV-_s8

But to sum up why he's so electable, I'll give you a couple of specifics too.

1. He polls really well against trump in head to head polls. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/National.html

2. He's very popular with independents. Even some former trump people are switching over to him. So he has the potential to get a much larger share of the vote. 
https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-sanders-does-better-with-independents/amp/

3. He doesn't have much baggage for Trump to attack that hasn't already come out. He's really the only candidate the media has vetted at this point. So those attacks won't sting much in the general. Contrast that with Biden who has been handled much more delicately than him. There's a lot of dirt that will be coming out into the mainstream for the first time during the general.

4. Bernie has the best ground game of any of the candidates. It's a lot more effective to have volunteers knocking on doors and talking on the phone with people than to rely only on ads.

5. He's motivating people who haven't voted in the past to vote more than any other candidate. Especially young voters and Hispanic voters. (the Nevada results show how strong that can be). 

6. Bernie is very popular in many swing states. That's important in the general because we need those states to win the electoral college. We can't just trust popular vote totals. He might even turn Texas blue, which would be huge!!! https://www.google.com/amp/s/thehill.com/opinion/campaign/479998-why-republicans-may-lose-texas%3famp",1,1583158618

241,trump,"It’s both racist and sexist to lump all Bernie supporters as “bro’s”. Bernie outperforms trump in nearly every poll. Enthusiasm is much higher for Bernie than Biden. We tried a moderate and she lost the rust belt, it’s clear that’s what the general electorate does not want.",1,1583164089

His ""no Malarky"" is amusing Helping him remember things like what his actual accomplishments are, what his policies are and what technology we use right now and how to keep it secure seem like uphill battles. We have a woman with detailed plans/policies, a strong aptitude for number crunching, a good grasp on technology/ innovation and her finger on the pulse of what our children need right now.

Also, I think Sanders can too easily be painted as a socialist/communist by the GOP (I’m not saying these accusations are full of merit), and that isn’t really going to be a great look come November.

395,trump,"1) Bloomberg is like a smart legitimate Trump. Bloomberg is worth 60 billion.
2) Let me get you started: if a Democrat gets elected than there is a tax code that will be abolished. It’s called the step up provision: “When an asset is passed on to a beneficiary, its value is typically more than what it was when the original owner acquired it. The asset receives a step-up in basis so that the beneficiary's capital gains tax is minimized. A step-up in basis is applied to the cost basis of property transferred at death.”

So if I have investments and I die, as of right now,  my beneficiaries pay no tax in gains before my death.

Democrat gets elected, including Joe Biden, the step up goes away. And your beneficiaries pay lots of tax on the gains before your death (20%). An investment gain of a million in your lifetime, the capital gains is $200,000. For every million you pass on in investments you’ll save $200,000 if a Democrat is not elected.

Bernie won’t beat Trump in battleground states. Super Tuesday proves this. Biden is the threat to the GOP. Now Bill Gates says, ‘I should pay more tax’ but may like Biden but not so much Bernie.

Bloomberg is only a philanthropist if he benefits.

405,trump,"A large portion of the 2016 Bernie vote was anti-Hillary. They then voted Trump in the general. Who knows if they've had enough of Trump or they'll give him another go in November. 

Likewise, a large portion of the Biden vote seems to be anti-Trump at all costs, and many were holding out until a frontrunner emerged, rather than picking one - some exit polls as high as 50% were undecided or changed their vote since last week. The massive Pete-Amy-Beto collapse behind Biden gave them their frontrunner, and in a familiar Obama's VP package.  - Remember, a ton wanted Biden from the start. They want Trump out, but they weren't signing up to start a revolution. 

I don't see it as a disappointment of the youth vote not showing up for Bernie - under 40's are always much lower in primaries, then they're scolded again when they don't show up in November for the candidate that makes no attempt to appeal to them.

On the other hand, if Dems pick Bernie, even Dems who don’t like Bernie will vote for him to oust Trump, meaning a united party that can beat Trump.

This has nothing to do with my political leanings or preferred candidates. This is simply the way that people are. Progressives, in general, are unwilling to compromise, for better or for worse. So if the Dems want a United party, they HAVE to play to the Progressives (aka nominate Bernie). If they don’t, we will see a repeat of 2016.

He uses lies and propaganda to evoke fear and hate from those who follow him. Fear is a very effective tool in our world. He chooses to push fear of immigrants, fear of “deep state dems,” fear of people of color. And most of it isn’t true, but unless people care enough to fact check, they will fall victim to it. And even if the truth is later revealed, it’s too late for many people to care/listen.

For example, saying to the republicans that democrats want to take their guns. It’s not true, many dems own guns! What most democrats want is what most reasonable people want-background checks, no loopholes, etc. 

When you aren’t as informed, you’re likely to fall victim to this, and what’s scary is that his followers are very brainwashed by their media and fear of other. Where other presidents worked to unite the country, he works to tear us apart. Hating your neighbor for their political affiliation. 

If you look up Trump maybe on Wikipedia, you can see that his whole life has been full of cheating, scams and failures.

Swimming in the same soup is not coalition building. Coalition building is working with somebody you may not agree with a history both sanders and Biden have.

 Biden's not a bad guy, he's actually very middle of the road for a US election and he might appeal to some of the undecided independents but remember that winning the independent vote it a mission.

Joe Biden, is going to be the candidate.

I don't agree with him on much, but at least he won't destroy the country.""

&gt;After a trump era how will Biden improve your personal life better then Bernie?

Biden will promote sensible, possible policies like hopefully rejoining TPP, carbon cap and trade, and maintaining our current nuclear and liquid natural gas extractive capacity. Biden will let me keep my health insurance.

Bernie will promote shitty, impossible policies like continuing Trump's protectionism, he will ignore cap and trade and other useful tools to cut emissions like nuclear power. Bernie will blow up the healthcare system and who the hell knows how that will turn out.

For Republicans yes. I want Bernies ideas to come to fruition. But he needs to describe them in terms of a process, not a foregone conclusion. I haven't supported him for one reason: he has no path to accomplishing what he describes even if we discount the enormous price tag. A carpenter who wants to build a house needs more than a drawing. Tools supplies and the labor. Legislatively it is not there. We need dignity and diplomacy restored to the White House.

He's against Medicare4All (Bernies policy), he's against a lot of Financial industry regulations (Warren's specialty), he doesnt talk much about immigration, he just...really wants to be President, I guess. He has made a point of saying he can work with Republicans, which is a tell that he sees brokering deals - any deals- that count as legislative accomplishments to be ""wins"" for him. This has been a problem in the past. What his or your preferred policy might be may matter less than what Biden can trade with Mitch McConnell to get a ""win"". Looking at Joe Biden on a POLICY basis, as you put it, may be a disappointing exercise.",1,1583370885
496,trump,"&gt;Not talking about Trump-beatability

But that's a big part of it. Honestly why vote for something better if something better is less likely to win? You don't vote for what you like best, electability needs to be the chief concern

But also, Joe's electability helps with taking back the Senate too,which helps him get more done

And a lot of us just aren't leftists. America is a center right country, there's a lot of moderates in the party who are fine with incremental reforms in a liberal direction but who don't want big tax increases or huge expansions of government either. Biden is good because he's got a broad platform that takes incremental moves on many issues that both moderates and leftists care about. So he's a good common ground. And his ideas are the types of things that could pass a narrowly Democratic Congress, which is good when it comes to building up realistic expectations rather than promising voters so much free shit and then not being able to deliver. And for the leftists who really dislike him, well, he still brings the country closer to progressive ideals, and gives a base on which to build future progressive reforms or incremental reforms that bring us a little closer to your ideals

Also he's one of the more pro trade Dems, which is great. Protectionism sucks, from Trump or more leftist sorts. We should have free trade instead, it makes us all better off. And isolationism just isn't great. America mist have a strong role in global affairs if we don't want the Russians and Chinese to just dominate everything. Being pro nuclear is also very important for climate change. And being against ""wealth taxes"" is always a plus",1,1583372247

I have posted over on some Bernie subs (I'm a Bernie supporter: surprise!) that Warren's base doesn't owe us a damn thing, it's our job to inspire new votes to come to the booths, but people keep moaning as if Warren's % is going to immediately translate to Bernie when the reality is it would fracture and the majority of it would probably go to Biden. 

Bernie definitely has some immature people making loud noises and doing obnoxious, sometimes grotesque things on the internet and not enough fellow supporters are stopping it, and if some of the Chapo House claims are true, then Bernie's campaign isn't doing enough to stop it. 

For the record I do not believe that Biden has a snowballs chance in hell in beating Trump, but I also don't necessarily know if Bernie does either.

It's funny, democrats are, or should be, fully aware of the Mueller report and the russian propaganda campaign. But when it comes to ""Bernie bros"", which was orchestrated and continues to be propagated by Russia, not only does the left wing media completely ignore that fact straight from the Mueller report, but democrats themselves seem to just believe every hostile person on the internet is representative of a single candidate.

It's not like Bernie is calling for the burning of churches here. Its literally infuriating that people can actually blow such dumb nonsense out of proportion.

But it serves us right, Democrats didn't want to listen when it came to HC. We continually have no problem nominating people wrapped in scandal-bows for the GOP to dismantle in the general. We just look the other way when Hillary Clinton goes to a private, wealthy gathering and tells them you should have a public and private persona. We just look the other way when CNN is leaking debate questions to her. We just look the other way when she bit-bleached her hardware after it was requested for review. Meanwhile we're suppose to make the case that if you have nothing to hide you shouldn't hide your taxes, Mr. Trump. Yeah, doesn't sound so good.

And now comes Biden. Any Democrat that thinks this entire Burisma thing looks 100% clean is straight up delusional. The GOP told Trump to quiet down and save that ammo for the general. It's the only reason they stopped with Burisma. The republicans are withholding all their attacks. There's more related to Hunter, with Biden voting for bankruptcy bills that Hunter's credit company wanted passed while he was on the board. Meanwhile they'll also push the block Bernie narrative in an attempt to piss off the liberal wing of the party.

And frankly, I take issue to his attempts primary democrats he doesn't agree with. The way we can defeat Republicans is together. All of us. And that doesn't include purging the party of moderates, nor does it include taking our balls and staying home or voting for Jill Stein or Trump, the way that a substantial number of Sanders supporters did.

As I've commented elsewhere, if voting was fair &amp; trustworthy, if latinos &amp; PoC were given the same access to the voting booth as white people, there would be almost no GOPer-run states.  
  
GOPers have a vested interest in making sure voter participation is low. GOPers, including Trump, had the maximum number of people voting for them in 2016 and every election before that.  
   
Whenever turnout is high it's because more people are turning up to vote Democrat.When the party names &amp; other identifying information is removed from policy documents, Democrat policies have 70% support nationwide. GOPer policies barely make it to 30%.  
  
No federal election is a contest of ideas. Democrats need to learn that and soon. A three word slogan beats a comprehensive 20-point plan every time.  
Elections are a battle over turnout. The aim of Democrats nees to be turning out enough people to overcome GOPer suppression tactics. Here's a list I did for someone yesterday.  
  
While the policy wonks are working out what to do when the Democrats win government, every other Democratic voter &amp; candidate needs to be figuring out how to overcome each &amp; every obstacle on that list.  
At a guess, I'd say people from heavily Democratic states need to be organizing like they did in the Civil Rights era, since that's where the Supreme Court has set us back to.  

Democrats need to be hammering GOPers in court over re-opening all the closed polling stations. Volunteers need to be organizing buses to escort voters through the GOPer intimidation tactics.  
Democrats need to be doing a lot more to combat voter suppression and not just for big elections.  
Democrats need to be organized for when someone runs for Mayor, Sheriff, dog catcher, whatever...  
  
otoh, now that GOPers have captured the courts, the media &amp; the executive, perhaps those people who decided they don't care about all the 'unimportant' things like judges &amp; SCOTUS picks need to experience what life's like under the American Taliban before they'll wake the fuck up to what they're doing.  
  
After Stacey Abrams had the governorship stolen from her in 2018, Democrats in Georgia had the opportunity to set the rules for 2020 when the runoff for Georgia secretary of state ran a week after the midterms.

Ahem.

«mistreatment from the Bernie base»

Okay, no, this just ain't it.      
Imagine not voting a candidate not because you don't like their electoral history, policies, visions or capabilities to implement their agenda, but just because of a couple of Twitter accounts being «mean?!». What a ludicrous, lame excuse that I just can't bear.

What is this aesthetic of liberalism and progressivism hindered underneath a 3-inch deep blanket that these people are even aiming at? It's beyond me.

You're voting the man in the office, not his fans for God's sake! This is literally saying «sorry, I don't think that much of X, but I can't vibe with some of his friends so he must be trash». And even at any point in my life, I'd rather take Bernie's fan base (or w/e that means) simply because he shares the same interests as my middle-class arse than having to deal with those conservative Trump/Biden/Bloomberg followers.

This kind of behaviour is the epitome of placing your pride above the others. And I'm critiquing this exact toxic, masked «sense of pride» for one's lack of perspective on the matter or even desire /to understand/.",1,1583410252
555,trump,"&gt; This is just childish though. If they like Biden's policies better, cool. If they think Biden can beat Trump and Bernie can't, cool. But if neither of those are true, and they're just voting for Biden because their feelings were hurt, that's even more immature than the thing they say they're responding to. 

Most Warren supporters like me want to see coalition-building among Dems and we see that there's absolutely no coalition building in the Bernie camp.

This is why the bullying is important. Biden's campaign has reached out to the others and has incorporated those values, while Bernie is more of a ""join us or else"" mentality.",1,1583410551
556,trump,"TLDR: The democratic party is so diverse that any political cult of personality over the whole party is impossible (maybe for one wing of the party, but nothing more)

When looking at Canadian politics in comparison to American politics, one thing is clear. The democrats represent the entire political spectrum of Canada. The Conservative party is represented by anyone from Biden to Klobuchar, the Liberal Party is Klobuchar to Warren, and the NDP (a left-wing progressive party) is Warren and left (including Sanders). This makes the democratic party act highly irregular. It can't be united because you have such a diversity of political goals in the party. On both extremes you have both democrats who want to see neoliberalism continue, think Bloomberg, and radicals who want to overturn the entire system, if needs be violently (Sanders isn't the furthest left the party goes). In most political systems Sanders and Bloomberg wouldn't even be in similar parties, they would be on opposite ends of the political spectrum. In any normal political system, the democratic party wouldn't exist, you'd have 3-5 political parties, all vying for political supremacy, but then you get the Republicans.

The Republican party if parculular in its own way. Instead of having a make up like the Democrats, most Republicans are politically uniform, at least when it comes to how they vote. If you watch a democratic debate from 2016 and a republican debate from 2016 you notice a sticking difference. The republicans are arguing more about which candidate is a better republican, the scandal wasn't about what they thought would be the best policy on pot, but who smoked pot as a teenager. It wasn't about Trump's policies (which actually weren't that extreme in the end) but rather Trump's character. The democratic debates were what most nations would see as a debate between a conservative-centrists and a typical member of the left wing. They were arguing on policy, and not solely identity. The reason republicans only argue about identity is because republicans don't have anything else to argue about. Even radical Trump proposals, like making a border wall aren't really that extreme for republicans. Sure, Trump would build a wall that in the end wouldn't work, but this was just his idea of how to keep illegal immigrants out, which everyone already wanted to do. Trump is actually an average republican, his policies are things most can get on board with. Because republicans are so politically uniform, they have a very easy time uniting around their nominee, so long as they nominate an average republican.

That's why the analogy between Trump and Sanders is different. Sanders can't make a cult of personality even, if he wanted to, beyond the left wing of the party because his views are to far off of what so many moderate democrats want. A moderate democrat actually has a different end goal than a radical, whereas a radical republican wants basically the same world as a loyal moderate one. Thus, no one can unite the party, not since about 2010, because it's not really a singular party anymore, it's the entire political spectrum.",1,1583411227
557,trump,"There's a lot of factors that singularly led to a Democratic defeat in 2016. One of them is that Democrats continued a vitriolic nomination race far too long which divided rational people who were appalled by trump. So I agree that Democrats need to focus on the general election early and avoid a divided party. I feel the best way to do that is for ALL the candidates to drop out, say, by March 31st EXCEPT for the one who leads in popular nominating vote; and those who dropped out should unite behind the one who remains.",1,1583411509

And if I don't, then get charged by the government on top of that? Rediculous. ACA needs serious work, and honestly I don't know if Biden knows what is going on anymore.

I’ll argue until I’m blue in the face that Bernie is a better candidate than Biden, but don’t think I’m not going to be arguing for Biden over Trump, donating to the campaign, and overall supporting Biden as hard as I support Sanders.

603,trump,"It's great that you tell your kids to vote, and I'm glad that they do vote. But that doesn't erase the experience that we have had and the messages that it has sent us.

I'm 26 and a Californian. I grew up under Bush Jr. and became politically aware under Obama's term. 

The schools might have put up PowerPoints on how special we were, but the real message they gave us was that if you don't do what you're supposed to when you're supposed to that you weren't gonna be successful. If we spoke up, then it was just putting a target on our back.

We joined a workforce that supposedly was booming after the recession, but treats us like shit and pays even worse. We learned fast that if you spoke up about conditions that you were gonna be out of a job and have to look somewhere else for minimum wage.

Here in the Bay, we live in beat apartment buildings where you can't even bring up safety concerns bc the moment you do, the landlord will take it as an excuse to boot you from the unit so that they can give it to some techie who can pay $4000 a month.

These experiences show us that our voices don't matter, and no matter how many times the Dems say otherwise isn't going to change that.

And on the Dems. When we were getting older, old enough to see the world around us, Obama was coming into office. We were so excited, we were told that he was bringing with him hope for a bright future and one where we all mattered.

Instead we got stabbed in the back. Our government sold  out to corporate interests. They piled more troops than ever into their pointless meat grinder of a war in the Mid East. They ignored our concerns and deported our families.

People think we're insane for not wanted to participate in the political process. Why would we care about a process that doesn't care about us? That's what they've shown us time and time again. They call us workers too ignorant to understand the process and tell us instead to just vote for some upper middle class folks who are gonna magically make life better.

Obama? Trump? The only difference is that Obama put up a nice wallpaper to block the view. With Trump, people are forced to actually look the actions of this country in the eyes. 

I always vote. I've been lucky enough to land a Union job where I have the luxury of looking past the next pay period. But to spit on the millions who don't is just ignoring the underlying problems. Sure there a some who just don't give a damn. But for most who don't vote, it's because they truly believe that their vote will never matter.

I know this has been a ramble, and that my anecdotal experience is by no means the experience of every youth in the country. But I needed this rant. I'm tired of being told that it our fault that things don't change. I'm tired of being told that it's on my generation to fix the mess we're in. But that's the world we live in right?

So Ukraine gave up it's nukes. A decade later, Russia invaded Ukraine and is taking it back piecemeal.

621,trump,"I posted this on r/p, but I honestly think this is Trump's worst political mistake of his career so far, and may actually cost him voters (perhaps not a huge number, but some at the fringes).

Up to now he's been successful in using his strategy of deflecting, lying, yelling, and using things for his political gain. This has worked because a lot of what goes on doesn't actually affect his voters' daily lives so it's easy for them to ignore and go with what Trump says. Whether Trump has an excessive number of acting cabinet members, the Russia/Ukraine stuff, his grifting with his properties, and other stuff -- whether that's there or not, most people (Trump supporters or not) don't even notice without being told, which makes it easy to ignore or explain away.

But this is different. Coronavirus is something they can see in their own communities (or will be able to), and something they actually have to fear themselves. Closing the border with Mexico and criticizing the press aren't going to help when your elderly wife or mother gets sick, or when you have to fly somewhere for a conference, or if you start hearing of cases in your state. Then people might actually notice how ineffective Trump is.

625,trump,"That’s not what got Trump elected. No academic would say that, I study voting behavior, that is fr from why he won. If that is the argument then McCain should’ve beaten Obama. In a democratic society, blaming people who didnt support who you wanted to win for their loss is antithetical to the idea of democracy in the first place.

She lost because she took for granted PA, WI and MI, where there was widespread voter suppression to deal with, and she didn’t inspire the African American vote like she needed to. She was a very flawed candidate, and because of these flaws she was drug through the mud. I’m not a “Bernie Bro” those don’t exist, at least not in my experience, and I have a ton of it on the trail knocking on doors and making phone calls and going to events. I’m sure they exist but it’s not nearly as rampant as reported and far less impacting that inferred. Research won’t even support the idea of it, so stop trying to make it stick.

There are actual substantive reasons people did not like her, and chalking every person up to a Bernie bro, or a trumpet, or a racist, or a xenophobe, or, or, or, does nothing to change the outcome. Acknowledging the substantive rationales that led to her loss will, on the other hand, strengthen the party and help to avoid the missteps she made in 2016.

628,trump,"I voted for Sanders on Super Tuesday because I think he would have been more likely to defeat Trump in the general election. Why do I think this? I see it as a choice between two media narratives. If we had picked Sanders, the media would have made the election about Socialism. By picking Joe Biden, the media narrative will be about Burisma and Hinter Biden. Socialism is an idea - a relevant idea. Burisma and Hunter Biden are an irrelevant distraction. 

I believe Democrats can win an election that is about ideas. But fighting Trump in an election that is just wall to wall coverage of an irrelevant distraction? I think it will be like throwing Br’er Rabbit into the briar patch.

But I would never have guessed they'd be this important before SC, so I dont think we can be too critical of Bernie not throwing all his energy at Clyburn.

The candidates I liked best were Jay Inslee, Cory Booker, and Andrew Yang because I think climate change is the most important issue and I don’t see how it can be solved within the time frame we have without new investments in nuclear energy. 

But those guys are gone now and my choices on Super Tuesday were limited to Biden, Warren, Bernie, and Bloomberg. Of those four, the only two I thought would actually be viable were Sanders and Biden. I voted for Sanders (decided at the last minute) just because I think he would be more likely to win in the general election. My reasoning is that if the media narrative is about Socialism, well at least that is a relevant idea. But if the media narrative is about Hunter Biden and Burisma it will just be a repeat of “Hillary’s Emails” and Trump might win.  Maybe I am wrong. I sure hope so. I do think Biden would be a good President and I think Bernie would be a good President and either of them would be better than Trump. 

Trump seems like a guy who read the quote from Lyndon Johnson, “ white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket.

It is also notable that her second place finish in American Somoa on Super Tuesday gives her exactly 1 delegate to the Democratic National Convention.

Biden actually won 30% of young voters, Bernie only 46%. Biden blew him out everywhere else.
Biden also topped BOTH metrics, concerning voting for someone you agree with AND voting for someone who can beat Trump. Enthusiasm!

Turnout is stupendously high, and it’s especially high amongst moderate suburbanites (in one VA district it was up 1,000%) and in African American communities. That’s my measure of energy. From the stats that you linked, Biden is winning the “agree with me on the issues” so he’s generating a LOT of enthusiasm ostensibly because of his ideals/policy/character AND electability.

As far as Biden lacking the mental fitness to run the country I fully agree although it should be said so does Trump and we would be a lot safer and more prosperous under Joe no doubt but it's a weakness they will exploit and I fear he would lose. More concerning though is the Republican and Democratic establishments conviction and premature coronation of Biden as the nominee. I hope it doesn't go that way. He is and always has been Republican light with policies and votes going back decades that hurt Democratic values and economically vulnerable people. He won't be able to beat Trump by offering him out behind the woodshed and mixing his lines up. Bernie would be able to as the polling has shown for months by having the mental conditioning of a much younger man and the guts to go where is needed with rhetoric.

When I was transitioning from Buttigieg to Biden, I took a look at some of Biden’s recent interviews. He speaks fluidly, clearly, and engagingly, and is encourage you to Google some. He has senior moments where he spergs out, but these are by and large isolated clips taken out of context.

Second, the same could be said of Trump. Trump 10 years ago sounds like a veritable genius compared to Trump now, but his own deficiencies haven’t inhibited his ability to govern much.

It's as good as a vote for trump, but you need to re-read my comment. I said those 5-9% support an insane theory that if we vote in fascists now it'll spark a revolution. Susan Sarandon is an example of one of those who support that theory. But I might have worded that badly.

[During 2016 she stated:](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/jul/05/protest-all-you-like-susan-sarandon-in-effect-you-work-for-trump)

&gt;“Some people feel that Donald Trump will bring the revolution immediately if he gets in. Then things will really explode.”

And then after Donald Trump implemented his caging kid's policies she got arrested for protesting his policies, yet she in effect advocated for those policies by not sucking up her pride and endorsing and voting for the Democratic nominee. But that's her right, just don't expect us to respect that decision. 

I think a lot of you guy's need to think about your strategies a little more. What you're advocating for is giving Republicans more power and pushing them right so that you can push Democrats further left. This doesn't work for a number of reasons. Number one, any decent right leaning Republicans will enter the Democratic party and prevent you from ever winning the Democratic nominee. Number 2, most Dems are already center-left and any Dem nominee is going to appoint left leaning judges. By giving Trump and Republicans all of the judicial appointments, you've in essence prevented any left leaning legislation from being set into law when a left leaning congress takes power because right leaning judges can simply rule them unconstitutional. Democratic Socialists are better off working with Social Democrats, moderate Democrats, and any disillusioned Republicans to remove fascists.

First, in my defense I grew up in a religion that made great efforts to isolate its followers from politics and while I did vote Obama twice I was just as ignorant then as I was in 2016(ignorant as in didn’t know shit about civics/politics/history/etc). It wasn’t until early 2018 that I seriously began educating myself, I did so specifically because the extreme emotional reaction I was having regarding politics made me uncomfortable(I know a lot about how cults operate having been in one and my reaction was textbook cult).

Anyway, I’ve been reading a lot of philosophy and found my views are far more liberal than even I realized, I was just too scared to have my own opinions before now as I was more concerned with slotting into a pre-made ideology(which is actually a result of the religious conditioning I was subjected to as a child). Once I developed this new found self confidence I started actively challenging my own views in a way I never had before and realized what I knew deep down the whole time: Trump is essentially a cult leader and I had fallen into another cult where it was unacceptable to challenge doctrine. This is my personal opinion however, so take it with a grain of salt.",1,1583894555

It’s kind of a Nixon goes to China moment. He could because he was such a rabid anti communist no one doubted he wouldn’t hold a hardline. 

Biden’s team have already been pushed to the left of Obama and Hillary on healthcare (thanks Bernie) and talking about single payer which would be so much better than ACA. This is the best hope right now, that the moderate might actually be able to pull off some somewhat radical changes. It would be legacy defining. 

Biden has two advantages over Hillary and Obama. He’s not universally hated, he’s not black. That last point sounds coy but it’s not. The ACA was gutted by the Astro-turfed faux populist tea party which was the base of the birther movement that Trump exploited to get elected. The majority of the energy against Obama - a traditional centrist- was fueled in old fashioned racism - no matter what you hear otherwise. A lot of these people still don’t even think racism motivates them but they are the ones to say “I don’t want to sound racist but... proceeds to say racist things”. 

The only proof you ever need of this is Obamacare. Based on a Conservative Heritage Foundation idea promoted by Mitt Romney first. Republicans Soundly rejected the same idea presented by Obama because he was a radical/Muslim/foreigner/socialist/terrorist.

Everyone else can have their angry candidate that lives on soundbites. I want the person on my team that has the internal fortitude to play the long game to really impact change.

&gt; Picking the wrong candidate can encourage people to stay home and not vote

Turnout thus far in these primaries, and in 2018, pretty much prove people are not staying home. MI was up 36% from 2016, that is an insanely high number.

There are 2 things we can learn from this primary. Hillary was much more unpopular than most people realized. Bernie didn't have nearly as much support as it seemed, he mostly benefitted from the anti-Hillary vote.

Now we have to retool messaging, and maybe realize that while the base loves our policies, we lost the war in conveying to them that these policies are far from unachievable and are a winning platform. We failed there, also the young crowd sucks ass and chooses apathy as opposed to using their enfranchisement to enact change they desire.

The one thing I hope the electorate can stomach is an election like 2016, only with a candidate that has a penis and less of an ability to speak coherently.

With Biden they have a treasure trove of negative realpolitik that ranges from speeches supporting segregation, voting for NAFTA/the crime bill, being a lackey for the credit card industry, being a tad creepy with women and girls, yelling at Anita Hill and I getting she was a liar, arguing states should not be required to abide by the Roe decision, and the war in Iraq amongst others.

And most progressives will of course vote for Biden, as they did for Hillary, but they won't volunteer time for door knocking or get out the vote. Because people are essentially voting against something as opposed to voting for something.

But in contrast, Trump base is strong and motivated, they are fighting for their existence, because they fear their country is being taken over by Mexicans and other immigrants. A candidate needs strong support to compete against that level of conviction. 

Hence, my concern is, if the Biden Army is strong enough?",1,1584243178

Will the Biden base be able to run a strong enough campaign on their own to defeat Trump?",1,1584243446

Some Sanders supporters might vote for Biden, but they wouldn't canvass or donate. That's going to sandbag him when Trump's running hard against him on his record on NAFTA, social security, etc. while pumping up rumors of family corruption and dementia.

In fact, Biden's strategy is a recipe for long term disaster. Even if he beats Trump, the second he's in office the Republicans will blame him for absolutely everything, and he'll have no counter argument because his whole campaigned hinged on not being Trump, who won't be there. The older voters he's relying on aren't going to be around forever, and the disaffected Republicans he's counting on are just going to shift back in the next midterms. Meanwhile the young Bernie supporters will be just as disaffected. They definitely won't turn out for Biden in 2022 *or* 2024",1,1584245070

1233,trump,"Important, but not as precarious as the people yelling on Reddit would like you to believe. 

Most Bernie supporters have the sense to know that they need to vote blue come November, and the ones that refuse aren't enough to lose Clinton the popular vote last time, so they shouldn't be enough to sabotage the more popular Biden, particularly given how a decent amount of the hype seems to have died down over the last five years.

More importantly, and maybe more cynically, if Biden has a choice between appealing to more moderates and unifying people or pandering to the three percent of people who are determined to never see him in office, the choice is obvious. People who see anyone but Bernie as corporate puppets looking to etcetera etcetera probably aren't going to be convinced by anything short of Biden taking off a mask to reveal that he was Karl Marx all along. You can't reason with people who refuse to use logic. 

Biden has won plenty of states that previously went Sanders, has created record turnout in the primaries, and isn't the most hated politician in the country. He is eminently stronger than Clinton in terms of both support and position, and Trump has disillusioned a not insignificant number of his former fans.

He promised something different, and we got it, he no longer has that behind him, and is going in with a weakening economy, an impeachment, and four years of mishandling everything. Maybe not enough to shake his base, but enough to leave the people in the middle in a place to be convinced.",1,1584245310

It's more important to have a lot of people with a medium amount of political involvement than a small group of people that are tirelessly devoted. That's not to say that youth vote is not important, the campaign will need to reach out to them, but they aren't the only group that matters. 

And don't forget how bad Trump sucks. America didn't know just how bad he would be when he ran the first time. I think the suburban moderate vote is going to be key to winning the election.",1,1584246201
1236,trump,"Hmm.... I don't feel good about the impact of how much Trump sucks... Republicans simply don't care what he says or does. The more vile and moronic he gets the harder they defend him.

And this is what we were told in 16, Trump sucks so bad it's a guaranteed win for Hillary. I remember Obama read a mean tweet on Kimmel and said Trump will never win. Hillary was almost celebrating months before the election. All my friends said have faith, Americans will never allow it. But Trump won.

So, I don't feel good about supporting a campaign that's primarily based on Trump's incompetence.

Trump will be nasty, and his supporters will fight with a lot of conviction. That's why I feel you need an Army of faithful to counter Trump. One simply cannot defeat Trump by running a standard campaign with a few rallies here and there with a same set of scripted speeches.

You need a movement for sure, much like Trump's or Bernie's, even Obama had a movement going on for himself, both left and moderates volunteered for Obama, and lefties were a big part of it.


The Moderates did a great job of getting together behind Biden. But they now have to step up and make it count in November.

I hope Biden can start a 'moderate' movement that inspires all the moderates to chip in with time and money. If they count on Trump's incompetence it could backfire all over again.",1,1584247748

1. His MAGA base is exactly the same.

2. He still has enough support from Republicans and moderates to closely hold on to his presidency. 

Just look at how they protected him during impeachment. Nobody else but Romney stood up against Trump.


And the Economy in it's current state will be marketed favourably for Trump. We keep hearing how the Trump administration has the lowest unemployment in many years.

I don't fully agree about Hillary's negatives. Trump campaign just did a really good job of circulating her negatives. It wasn't even a factor until WikiLeaks got involved.

But two of our gaming friends work delivering packages for the Post Office and the virus lasts 2 days on cardboard. A third member of our group has a kidney transplant. A fourth member is recovering from a bad car accident. Our game masters are high school teachers. So the ways to get the virus are pretty high with our group, and the potential victims  are at higher risk.

But that risk is, at its HIGHEST, 15% for fatality. From the disease. However, the part that is deadly for them wouldn't be the virus, but from the complications. Doug won't die from COVID-19, he'll die because his immune system icompromised and his transplant fails. That won't show up on the initial total of deaths. That will show up much, much later when health officials are allowed to truly assess. And their response will be, ""There's no way to know for sure how many people died from complications, but we know that the failure of this administration to prepare for it added exponentially to a death toll that was already on a curve like that.""

And once again, Trump will get off scot free, with absolutely no repercussions, no consequences. Mitch McConnell said all the Republican Senators needed to read the entire 110-page bill proposed before voting on it. And if they don't, then he won't hold a vote on it. My friends could die because McConnell wants all the seats on the SCOTUS. My father might die because Trump is figuring out how to keep grifting from the taxpayers and being a racist POS about a fucking ineffective border wall. My brothers and sisters, all over the age of 60, will be at risk because PENCE decided to ""pray away the virus"" instead of being transparent about the symptoms and risks. My friend with the cracked ribs from a car accident might die because Trump blamed Chinese people instead of allowing widespread testing. My entire world can be destroyed because a white nationalist was elected who wasted time and resources instead of using the same tests the rest of the world is using.

I think you misunderstood. Bernie asking for M4A is fine. It's only a problem when he's also picking a fight with 20 people at once and somehow expecting to win any of them. If I told you I was going to get into a fight with 20 other people at the same time, do you think I would win any of those fights? Let alone all of them?

Doing one big thing is already hard. It is really hard. It is messy and chaotic and generally a clusterfuck of problems that nobody saw coming. There's a reason people don't just burn the whole thing down and start over. Because it's really fucking hard to build something new.

So Bernie platforming on M4A is fine. One big fight for one big problem, deal with the rest later. Bernie is not going to win anything if he's trying to take on all the big dogs at once.

&gt; Trump is a lunatic, but he's right when he says you don't come in to a negotiation weak.

Being strong only matters if you're actually invited to the negotiation. Nobody wanted to hear Trumps BS. Despite all his ""strong man"" tactics, it barely got Trump anything.

He tried to come in ""strong"" with his wall. Maybe he hoped by starting high he could negotiate better. Whatever his thinking, he got jack shit. Even when he kicked and screamed and threatened shutdown, nobody gave it to him. Including his own fucking party.

Same thing with NAFTA, came in hard saying this is the worst deal in history. 4 years later we have UMSCA, which is really just old NAFTA with some modernization updates around things like internet and IP.

Same thing with China trade war. 2 years of high and mighty rhetoric and phase 1 of the trade agreement only really only has China buying lots of US trade goods. No resolution on IP enforcement or currency manipulation.

One reality is the Rockwellian dream of a post war America that did nothing but expand, and it was awesome as long as you were a white heterosexual guy with a doting wife.

The other reality is the ugly truth of racism and other cultural biases that are as old as America and which had been avoided in “polite conversation” until the late 1950s when we could no longer avoid the vast tracts of society we were ignoring.

Add that to the downward pressure by one type of elite who is in this for themselves only, and the other type of elite who realizes their status comes from the productive output of people and infrastructure that matter.

These are the competing narratives. Obama pulled us one way. Trump boomeranged us back. But it’s not like this addressed culture. It’s only who games the electoral college better and then proceeded to stack  the deck against the opposition better.

What the parties do at the state and local level is WHY we have cockamamie electoral maps, WHY electoral votes can have a different proportion than popular votes, WHY we get only certain candidates and WHY we get only certain judges and policies. It also is the truth about where legislative power truly sits.

This is an hour by hour fight, not something that rests between the quadrennial fashion show for POTUS.

FEMA has been — you know, usually we see FEMA for the hurricanes and the tornados.  Now we have FEMA involved in this.  They’ve been doing a fantastic job locally working with people that they know because they work — like, as an example, in California, in the State of Washington, they work with them a lot on other things, and they’re very familiar.  So they’re working on it.

&gt;What you can do and all you can do is — professional, totally competent.  We have the best people in the world.  We have, really, the greatest experts in the world.  And someday soon, hopefully, it’ll end and we’ll be back to where it was.
&gt;
&gt;But this came up — it came up so suddenly...we were all surprised.  We heard about it.  We heard about reports from China that something was happening and all of a sudden — we did make a good decision; we closed our borders to China very quickly, very rapidly.  That was a — that was a — otherwise, we’d be in a very — as Tony has said numerous times, we’d be in a very bad position, much worse than we would be right now.  You look at what’s happening in other countries: Italy is having a very hard time.

&gt;when it comes to helping people in a crisis we will step up and help

Y'all didn't do it before, that's for sure

&gt;So instead of shitting on Trump and Mitch McConnell to your Republican friends

What, don't shit on the people who have acted quite shitty over the course of this crisis? I mean the rapist in the white house is the guy who started off saying the coronavirus is ""the Democrats' new hoax"". And he's repeatedly been incompetent, making outright false statements regarding things like whether Americans abroad can return home, whether trade will be cut off, the whole Google testing thing, and so on, in a way that has had an impact on the stock markets. Plus there's the things like him firing the pandemic response team, a thing which directly hurts in this situation, and then just forgetting it even happened-but then I guess that's the way for his followers to just blame it on the (((deep state)))🙄-and also sought to cut funding for the CDC. So given all this garbage from the Trump admin, why the hell shouldn't we be shitting on them? They literally have blood on their hands at this point, what more does Trump need to do, literally shoot someone?

&gt;Tell them that the Lord would want us to help and take care of each other in a most important time of need in or life’s. I know we are stubborn hard headed people but try to push the humanity part of this situation.

I don't care what the lord wants us to do, government isn't a damn theocracy. Plus it's pretty rich to go on about how the lord wants us to help each other and take care of each other, and to say we should ""push the humanity of the situation"", when we are talking about the party that puts the wealthy above the common good, and the people who vote for that party because they oppose helping and taking care of undocumented americans, and refugees, and people who don't speak their same language, and trans and other lgbt kids, and minorities oppressed by a biased justice system who want to affirm that *Black* Lives Matter, and women who don't want to adhere to traditionalism or to have their basic rights to abortion denied? 

Let's be real, liberals have been talking about how the core ideas behind Republicanism go against these ideas of what the lord says for decades, and the response has increasingly just been ""well who are you libs to talk about what the lord wants and say we are inconsistent, you often aren't even religious yourselves and don't support religion in politics yourselves"" as if it is hypocritical for us to point out the right's hypocrisy on this stuff. Hell, even when Democrats *are* religious, they are just smeared for not being the particular death cults of fundamentalist christianity that the right loves, you could see that shit going on recently with Mayor Pete for example. So if the right didn't give a shit in the past, why should we expect people who were lifelong Republicans and voted for people like Bush, McCain, Romney, and goddamn Trump to give the slightest of shits *now* about ""helping and taking care of each other"" (as opposed to just making sure a privileged few are taken care of) and caring about ""the humanity part of this situation"" when they have so rarely cared about it in the past?

Look, if you want to join the right side of history and actually support decency, go right ahead. Vote blue and support the party that pushes sensible liberal reforms to help people. Just don't expect people to forgive and forget what the GOP has done (and undoubtedly will continue to do) and what it's supporters have gleefully enabled (and by and large will continue to support). Don't expect real life politics to be like a thing where you can just go into a confessional and come out with all sins absolved because you say you are genuinely sorry. Though with some of the things you've said here that sound like deflecting or excusing blame (""oh, we are just old fashioned and stuck in our ways""), I'm not even sure you'd take it that far. Regardless, this is the sort of thing where walking the walk will go a lot further than talking the talk. If we want to avoid this shit in the future, we should be very active in pointing out the bullshit, rather than going soft on it in order to try to peel off what ultimately will be no more than a trickle of Republicans-even for those of us who are closer to the moderates than to the hard left and support that sort of political appeal, victory will hinge on whether we can swing the people in the middle, not those at the right, and a big part of our ability to do that is how much we can make it absolutely clear that Trumpism and conservatism are absolutely morally bankrupt, and making it clear that, as much as the right may complain about us shitting on them, well, they are just shit. And that doesn't mean we don't focus on the humanity of the situation, we've been focusing on that for decades anyway for fucks sake, just not in ways that have been acceptable for the party that often wants to ignore the humanity aspect and will likely continue to do so",1,1584470644

And no intelligent person said otherwise.  They said that Sanders would be looking to cut a deal and bring joe over to some of his policies so that voters can then endorse Biden via Sanders to beat trump.  Hell they both said this in the debate.

But Biden lied repeatedly.  Also he made factual mistakes...and he had vague general answers to specific and serious issues.  Also claiming Sanders had 9 super pacs was absurd and his refusal to name even one was embarrassing and trump like.

The point is Biden is the weaker of the two intellectually but he will be the candidate though he may fail against trump because he failed agaisnt Sanders in debate.... who like you correctly said...went easy on him.

Sanders understood as did Joe it helped no one to tear each other apart. How fucking selfish and trump like would that be during a pandemic ?  And this country has been disease for over 4 years under trump and before.

Any one down voting the fact that Biden needs to be a better debater....is a fucking idiot and an enemy of democracy. Because trumps regime is the very poison and division which would see the dream die.  

So we should be sending our best against him. And if all we can manage is Biden...then he needs to be better ...as I clearly stated.  He needs to be So much better if he is to best trump in a way which unites America and kills trumps and his protege future in politics.

America needs revolution and if so called patriots have forgotten it was revolution which made America free of red coats... then freed the slaves... then gave the vote and equality and social security and everything of worth came from revolution. 

So fuck anyone who says we don't have time for revolution.   Fuck biden when he said that.  He didnt even realise how ignorant that statement was.  If I didn't know he was a decent man I'd imagine he was a republican.

Trump won off the promise of a revolution but it wasn't the one we expected.  Sanders offers us an attempt at better.  If Joe wants to win he then has to actually lead to unite a nation. Trump won but he didn't..can't lead.  Biden needs to be better and it starts with a united party.  If he can't achieve that ...he will fail. And if he fails ...we all fall.

Look at the idiots over on chapo telling their listeners this crap day in and day out. You think those guys are going to be hurt by a single thing Trump's administration does? They are literally the primary beneficiaries. 

Look at the posts made in the Sanders subs calling Biden the apocalypse, then look at how many have ""as a Canadian"" somewhere in their comments. 

Look at the people complaining about anything short of medicare for all killing people and see how many are under their parents' insurance or have private insurance in the first place. 

So many people seem to be there for the cult of personality and the attention of being a woke revolutionary fighting The Man.

I hold a great deal of respect for the work Sanders had done in pushing America left. I supported him in 2016 up until it was clear he had list and I hoped to see him do well this year. The party today would not be pushing a more progressive platform even at their least digressive candidate if he hadn't brought some of these issues to the forefront of our nation's discussions.

They noted that their policy views cover a spectrum and as officials they “have often been in opposition, sometimes bitterly, with each other.”

A flat unconditional benefit is the fastest, cheapest way to distribute money.   At least ten times faster and cheaper in distribution costs than any other technique.   

A flat benefit is the most progressive benefit, because the poorer you are, the ‘bigger’ it is in proportion to your overall budget.   

A flat monetary benefit is the most useful, because different people have different needs, depending what is going on in their lives.   

A flat monetary benefit is much fairer to every person than bailing out failing businesses, while at the same time it saves businesses as well as people by putting spending money in their hands.

Coming back round to a flat benefit being progressive because the poorer you are the more useful it is to you; and the more of the money you are likely to spend instead of save.   Hopefully staving off a depression, if not an inevitable recession.   This is the best, most fair, economic stimulus one could hope for, if you need an emergency economic stimulus not delayed by paperwork.   

Yes, the USA should have Medicare available for all, to to cover medical needs.

This unconditional flat benefit is excellent to help out the economy and Amercans’ financial needs.    My only criticism is that I think America desperately needs a year of this money, payed out monthly, to get everyone through.

Former Republican political consultant Rick Wilson said it in 2015, said it through 2016, and still says it today.  There is no evidence to prove otherwise.   

When Trump told his dead, soulless sycophants to erase any vestige of Obama's presidency through executive order, among the culling was the establishment of the White House Office of Pandemic Response.  It wasn't a permanent ""office"", but a plan on the ready the moment the WHO and CDC declared an epidemic so we could kick in remedies to a potential pandemic ahead of the world so we would have nothing in the way for our endless resource of American companies to develop and distribute vaccines ahead of the spread of a potential virus in a pandemic.

But Trump doesn't think about 10 years from now, let alone 10 weeks, 10 days, or 10 minutes from now.  He sways back and forth at daily press conferences bored that he can't be somewhere else.  He attacks a reporter for asking him a question that, honestly, was a softball he could have used to his advantage to inspire.

It's all about him and if it means destroying everything because he's a short-term thinker with a tender ego, well enjoy his version of revenge at your peril.

Harris is from California, a state that will go Blue as long as they don’t put Vladimir Putin on the ticket. Would be a strong presence on the stump, but who knows if there’ll be stumping?

Abrams brings strong support from the black community, but is relatively unknown outside of Georgia. And remember, she *lost* her only race. Plus, Biden already has overwhelming support in that community, plus Obama on his side 

Klobuchar puts Minnesota in the bank, you’d think...and that’ll be more important than usual this time. He also needs Wisconsin, Michigan and probably Ohio to see it up. But, everybody already got a look at her during the run-up and took a pass.

Whitmer is interesting because she’s a Midwestern governor on the forefront of the Coronavirus battle, making hard executive decisions everyday. Relatively young (48). Shown she can win in a Purplish state (Michiganders mainly go Blue for President — before Trump, last time was ‘88; usually go Red for governors — 40 of last 60 years, Michigan’s Governor has been a Republican.)

Bux, in Kentucky, says, “There’s absolutely no way to protect myself.”  A surgeon in Fresno, California, says, “We are at war with no ammo.”  Dr. Mell, in Illinois, says, “If this is a wartime situation, then now is the time to act.”

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’ll tell you the way I look at it.  So, many administrations preceded me.  For the most part, they did very little, in terms of what you’re talking about.  This is unprecedented.  You can speak to Tony; you could speak to anybody.  This is unprecedented or just about unprecedented.

We’ve also gotten tremendous reviews from a lot of people that can’t believe how fast it’s coming.

Trump never sells it this way.  He simply allows it to remain a broad cultural slur and further encourages his base to hate YET ANOTHER group of people, not their cancerous government.  He takes full advantage that his followers don't think, they just FEEL.

He's doing the same exact thing the PRC had no choice but to say  ""oops, my bad"" just recently.  (The PRC still sucks tho.)

1910,trump,"Here’s an excerpt from the cease and desist letter. Their argument is that “Trump was not calling the outbreak a hoax but rather was referring to the Democrat’s falsification of his record in an attempt to discredit his Presidency.”

This seems laughable on lots of levels. For one, trump accusing anybody of making “false and misleading claims” is just ridiculous, he’s lied so much about basically every topic out there. He’s popularized conspiracy theories, and even abused his power to push those (often Russian born) theories to the public without any evidence. On top of that, these are his words, the quotes are edited together, but he said all these things. And if you read the context of the quote, by saying hoax, potentially he is actually talking about the criticism he’s received for his handling of the crisis (rather than the crisis itself) but the fact that this his administration has failed in handling this crisis, how can that criticism be a hoax? The context continues where he follows that up by talking about how there’s only 15 people (downplaying the urgency of the crisis) and making the case that he did in fact mean the Coronavirus crisis itself is the hoax he is referring to. 

&gt;PUSA stitched together fragments from multiple speeches by President Trump to fraudulently and maliciously imply that President Trump called the coronavirus outbreak a “hoax.” As fully set forth in the enclosed facts sheet, and President Trump’s full quote below, the facts show beyond reasonable doubt that he was talking about the Democrat’s politicization of the outbreak when he used the word “hoax.” Multiple independent fact checkers have debunked the exact same false claim made in a Biden campaign ad. Because PUSA’s ad’s central point is deliberately false and misleading, your station has an obligation to cease and desist from airing it immediately to comply with FCC licensing requirements, to serve the public interest, and to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation.

&gt;First and foremost, President Trump’s own remarks demonstrate that he was referring to the Democrat’s politicization of the coronavirus outbreak when he used the word “hoax”:

&gt;Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that, right? Coronavirus. They’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs, you say, “How’s President Trump doing?”, “Oh, nothing, nothing.” They have no clue, they don’t have any clue. They can’t even count their votes in Iowa, they can’t even count. No, they can’t. They can’t count their votes. One of my people came up to me and said, “Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.” That didn’t work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they’ve been doing it since he got in. It’s all turning, they lost. It’s all turning, think of it, think of it. And this is their new hoax. But you know we did something that’s been pretty amazing. We have 15 people in this
massive country and because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that.

&gt;Moreover, multiple independent fact-checking organizations have debunked the core claim of the PUSA ad: that President Trump referred to the coronavirus outbreak as a hoax. According to The Washington Post Fact Checker, checking a Biden campaign ad, “[t]he full quote shows Trump is criticizing the Democrat’s talking points and the media’s coverage of his administration’s response to coronavirus. He never says that the virus itself is a hoax.” (Meg Kelly, Biden Ad Manipulates Video to Slam Trump, The
2 (President Donald J. Trump, Remarks at a Campaign Rally, Charleston, SC, 2/28/20).

But if you think there is grounds for negotiation on stuff like incest and rape  exceptions or keeping the number of weeks from conveption to low numbers then I think you can vote Denocrat and not compromise your morals.

I think the GOP is rotten to the core. 

On the ither issues, I think you will find there isn't as much room as you think between you and Nanci Pelosi. You might find yourself lockstep on things like Veteran's issues and healthcare.

1939,trump,"Its quite simple.  So you want policy based on science, facts, data, and experts? Or do you want people to do what they “feel” is good, mostly for themselves?

If anything, the state of America right now should be all the proof you need.

Republicans allowed Trump to gut our funding for CDC.  He fired and never replaced the Outbreak Desk at DHS set up by Obama after Ebola specifically to take lessons learned to prevent future outbreaks from reaching the US.

Their penny wise pound foolish fiscal policy has left our institutions underfunded and underprepared and now we are going to spend TRILLIONS to “bail” out everyone when a few billion here or there cut could have prevented this from being as bad as it is.

Republicans insistence on gutting regulations to increase profits again will bite us all in the ass because if you think Covid-19 is bad, wait until the upcoming increased frequency of climate change related disasters hit the US, and we wont have any money to help- because we are about to break the bank.

1942,trump,"So I voted straight Republican since Ronald Reagan was President. I am a fiscal conservative and fell for the lie that Republicans were also. I am more libertarian when it comes to social issues. I don't care what you do as long as it does not affect me or hurt me and mine.

 When 2016 came around, I knew well in advance that I would not vote for Hilary. I was hoping for a good Republican to run against her. What we got was Trump. I saw during the campaign him say something during a debate and after the debate deny he said it. I saw him mock a disabled man. I heard his disjointed speeches. I heard the grab em by the pussy tape. I read about the sexual assault accusations. I could not vote for him. I read dozens of books about him and am more well versed about his lifetime criminal activity than 99% of Americans.

 I voted third party in 2016.

After the election I started doing research about the Republican party. The first thing I saw was that when the R's were in power the deficit went up and when the D's were in power the deficit went down. That was the start of my journey of discovery. What I found blew my mind. Among many other things, the R's are responsible for Citizens united. The Koch brothers funded the drive to get that passed. Their lawyers flooded the supreme court with briefs and their lawyer argued the case for Citizens United before the Supreme court. It was passed with 5 Republican nominated judges and opposed by 4 Democratic judges. This is all you really need to know to never vote for a Republican again. They stole our Democracy and turned it into an Oligarchy.

 I am not ready to call myself a Democrat. I refer to myself as an Eisenhower Republican like Republicans were when they believed in the rule of law and helping all Americans and not just the 1%.

1947,trump,The world lost another proud Trump supporter... and no one cared...,1,1585284527
1948,trump,"This is not true. 

If you make errors quoting him there has to be some irony in saying a man with a speech impediment had a small stumble in long interview. 

The answer he gave made sense in context. It was so Sara Haines on The View when asked about Trump's idea to get people back into the workforce soon because of the ""cure"" potentially being worse than the virus. 

Biden latched onto the word ""Cure"" from Trump and before directly responding to the point of the question he said that 'finding a cure' was the top priority, then he answered the Actual question saying 'that can only make things worse"" - Referring to Trump sending people back into the workforce.

I urge you not to collect anecdotes about what are claimed errors by a man with a famous speech related disability. Go and find the context of what you hear every time.

E.g. people have compilation clips of Biden where they show him referring to Chris Wallace as ""Chuck"" at the end of an interview as if this shows total degradation.. by contrast Bernie has an interview in person, sitting right in front of Wolf Blitzer and looking right at him and calls him ""Jake"" FIVE times ! 

It's nuts. Nobody records Bernie's stumbles but they damn well will if he wins the nomination, bet you Conway has a highlight reel she is proudly and excitedly curating",1,1585284728
1949,trump,"Probably for an election or two.

However, the Democratic party stands for none of those things, so you might find yourself hard pressed to vote for any candidates when they aren't up against someone like Trump.

From my own, personal point of view, Dems and Republicans have two equal and opposite roles in our society. When they work in concert, everyone prospers. Republicans used to focus upon helping innovation and supporting folks prospering, helping small businesses become successful. They enable our common defense by supporting the Military and make certain the government doesn't over regulate. They are against government overreach and having them interfere in people's lives.

Democrats are there for everyone who isn't rich. They are there watching out for the environment, making sure regulations are actually enforced, and that those suffering are cared for. They make sure upper end spending doesn't eclipse the needs of the many. 

Lately, the Republican party leaders have proven they don't give a damn about anybody but their own personal interests. If it doesn't keep them in power and getting rich, then to hell with it. When Democrats have given in good faith, the GOP has made them regret it. And it's pissing the rest of us off.

 The result is that the people who vote Democrat are not going to put up with it anymore. We aren't going to give on women's rights, because abortion has never been about babies. It has always been about controlling women. We can tell because when a Republican Pro-lifer gets his mistress pregnant, he pays for an abortion. When the torture of children happens at the border, Pro-life Republican leaders aren't standing up or stopping it. When funding is needed for WIC, children's school lunch programs, and CHIP, Republicans voted against it. Romney, a Mormon, whose church's philosophy is Family First, has not been loud and fighting for the ethical treatment of the children and families at the border. He's the shining example of resistance in the trump era.

We can have the strongest military in the world for 3/7ths of the military budget, still have plenty of pork barrel waste, and fund every program to help the poor and middle class, and NOT RAISE TAXES. The tax cut that passed two years ago? It lowered taxes for the super wealthy and deleted deductions for the people on the front lines of this pandemic. Truckers lost their food allowances. My own taxes, for a single income teacher's salary for a family of four, went up. Lots of people paid higher tax bills because, although they cut the mandate for health care, they also got rid of several deductions my family counted on. And this year is no different. 

Now this virus has shown the flaws in the health care system for Americans. Party first leadership tried to pull some pretty foul and heartless things. The attitude that we should die for the Dow is not faring well. I don't blame you for rethinking your focus. And I won't fault you for returning to your prior voter registration a few elections from now. But today?

Yelling and going crazy didn't desegregate schools, or end discrimination, it will only make it easier for the opposition, who is in control to crackdown on your misbehavior. 

What these reporters are trying to do is outsmart Trump and his followers. They need to clearly show to the American people and the world that what he is doing is wrong in black and white. In the 60's reporters showed firehoses and dogs being used on people peacefully asking for equal voting rights. During Vietnam, they showed Marines burning farms and villages, and the Airforce napalming children.  In the 80s they showed how women were being discriminated in the workplace even though they were more qualified than men. Now I believe they are showing that his administration's mismanagement of COVID19 killed Americans.

I tell this to my friends who are not black. Welcome to our world, as a black man every day is a struggle not to lash out and go crazy. When we go crazy and lash out we get arrested and end up another number in the broken system. You have to work within the system. Sue these Trumpers in court, the judge is elected by the people. Peacefully protest wrongs singing peaceful freedom songs, and show how THEY resort to violence. Get a job work your way up to the top and hire a diverse staff.

1997,trump,"It’s going to be close not matter what. Part of the reason trump won in 2016 is because Hillary was so incredibly unpopular, that isn’t a thing for Joe Biden. 

Breaking it down by state:

PA: Biden if from PA and is popular there. PA is a fairly purple state but voted blue for Obama and I think could easily switch back to blue for Biden. Bernie’s anti fracking stance makes him essentially a non starter in PA. With the proper outreach and dedication to the state, PA could easily swing back. 

MI: Michigan saw a blue wave in 2016 with large upset wins in traditionally red suburbs. If this trend continues Biden could win. Primary turnout was up 79% compared to 2016 which is good news for Dems. 

WI: because they haven’t voted yet we don’t know have many indicators for voter enthusiasm. However in 2018 Dems won important statewide races and congressional seats which is a good sign for Dems. However there is rampant voter suppression in WI put in place by outgoing GOP governor Scott walker. Dems need to greatly increase efforts here and dump resources into the state. 

OH: Had been getting increasingly red over the past few cycles and I think it’s fairly safe to say it will go red again in 2020 unfortunately. However I think the dem nominee and dem backing groups need to make trump work for it. Specifically focusing on all the promises he made to keep factories open that were bullshit promises. 

MN: Fairly safe blue. Especially if Amy is the VP or  high level cabinet nod. 

As for the south:

NC: North Carolina went blue for Obama in 08 and red in 12 and 16. The state has more registered Dems than republicans but an insane number of independents (more than 40% of RV). Voter suppression and gerrymandering here is arguably the worst in the country. Dems need to work extra hard to flip the state because the senate seat here is basically our only chance at flipping the senate. NC has a huge AA population and Biden is very popular amount AA so this could bode well for Dems. 

FL: Florida is essentially a coin flip imo. The restoration of voting rights to felons in 2018 and the growing Latino population is good news for Dems but the governor is doing everything in his power to increase voter suppression and prevent the restoration of all those voters. If Dems work hard and turn out latino voters Fl could very easily be in play.

2000,trump,"Why is this petulant child still president? Seriously, as one of his cabinet what could you possibly have to gain by keeping him in office? 

The 25th amendment has been talked about to death, but regardless of how *likely* it is, the fact is it's plausible. 

Under the amendment's fourth stipulation, it would only take 14 people to depose the president — Vice President Mike Pence and 13 of Trump's 24 cabinet members.

Section IV reads:
""Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.""

So what do these people think they're getting out of supporting him that they wouldn't get under Pence - and with significantly less baggage. Monumentally less baggage. They could get everything they have now, *and* Pence would go up against Biden and have a better shot at winning than Trump, so they'd be giving their odds of tenure a much better chance.

 [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/russia-sanders-campaign-taibbi-957377/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/russia-sanders-campaign-taibbi-957377/) 

&gt; Did the Russians actually do these things? Maybe. It’s not confirmed either way. The sourcing even today remains tied to the same people who’ve lied about a thousand other things, both in the course of this story and before, from WMDs to the missile gap. As we saw this week, when officials quietly began admitting their ideas about “what Russia wants” rested upon perhaps “[**overstated**](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/23/politics/intelligence-briefer-russian-interference-trump-sanders/index.html)” interpretations of intelligence, many of these narratives have been elaborate exercises in reading tea leaves. And they won’t let us see the tea leaves.   
&gt;  
&gt; The United States, whose spending on intelligence and the military alone nearly equals Russia’s GDP, could crush Russia for breakfast and take the rest of the day off for beer and volleyball. But officials have spent the past few years furiously constructing a popular vision of the Russian enemy far bigger than the actual country, which the likes of Rachel Maddow and Barack Obama not long ago were correctly calling a “[**gnat on the butt of an elephant**](https://twitter.com/maddowblog/status/449242948941934592?lang=en).”   
&gt;  
&gt; The logic of Russiagate is now beyond absurd. Vladimir Putin, somehow in perfect sync with American voting trends, seeks to elevate both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, apparently to compete against himself in the general election, in a desperate effort to suppress the terrifying political might of, say, Joe Biden. I doubt even Neera Tanden in the depths of a wine coma could believe this plot now   
&gt;  
&gt; That this is a dumb story is characteristic. The people pushing it don’t have any smart arguments left for remaining in power. Through decades of corporate giveaways, trickle-up economics, pointless wars, and authoritarianism, they’ve failed the entire population.

UNLESS you firmly agree that ANY and all politicians PROPOSED policy is not any sort of guarantee of what their platform would look like, in whcih case the argument for Bernie goes COMPLETELY out the window.

Its idiotic.  And I specifically asked about any policy and in order to avoid talking about the policy that you either 1) know nothing about or 2) want to avoid acknowledging is extremely progressive, youre dodging by talking about financial backing.

Benefitting finacial backers is extremely flimsy argument.    But thats the discussion YOU want to have so:

LETS HAVE IT.

Bernie didnt accept money from the NRA in his run for house seat in the 90s, he just let them spend money on advertising to denounce his republican opponent and jept his record silent, then voted in favor of NRA agenda policies because it was the REPUBLICANS who helped launch him into office.

The money was irrelevant because the votes are actually What matters, and as Bernie has proven you can have an incredible financial backing and still LOSE.   

What matters most is who VOTES you into office.

Trump?  Spent his adult life supporting universal healthcare, minimum wage, etc.   But the people.who voted him into office either hated those things or hated the democrats more than they wanted those things - dems didnt take him seriously - but he iant indebted to his donators (of which he has millions).  Hes indebted to his base of support in the electorate.

Biden has worked to push for universal healthcare, regulations on the healthcare industry, tax subsidies for the lower middle class - so forget his policy proposals, hes already got a proven record so the ""he serves corporate interests"" doesnt ring quite as true.

Sanders changed his tune.  

He used to be against immigration reform, saying that immigrants ""steal jobs from low wage workers."" 
He used to be firmly against background checks, against waiting periods.  Hes incredibly quiet about it now.
Why?  Because thats where the votes are coming from now.

But lets address the idea of corporate interests.

Are you saying that Bernies proposals are BAD for corporations?

I dont think Bidens are.  I dont think many of Bernies are either, except his support of Trumps tariffs, and the Trumps backing out of trade deals whoch have largely wrought chaos on the farming and manufacturing industry that relied on trade and saw a huge spike in costs of business.

But universal healthcare, and minimum wage are all great for corporate interests.  They put more capital into the economy, they help alleviate corporations with health insurance concerns, they improve effeciency and effectiveness.

Thats why historically a lot of corporations have SUPPORTED a progressive agenda, because many of them have a huge stake in the stability of the US economy and general Commonwealth.

The idea that corporations HAVE to support policies that diminish the middle and lower class, and that individual donations HAVE to support progressive causes is largely faith that someone sold you.

Considering Biden has already largely supported policies that were beneficial to the working lower and middle class, it would have to be assumed that he is capable of who actually votes for him.

So if you want to say ""All Campaign Policy Proposals Are Meaningless"", in which case you can no longer use any policy proposals as direct advocacy for your candidates future positions, then suddenly your own candidate looks like a guy who got $180 million in donations for copying John Conyers Medicare for All bill introduced in 2003 and claiming it as his own idea and then losing an election largely on his own remarkable ability to divide votes instead of unify them.

If you want to talk policy feel free, but this aint it chief.",1,1585373993

2081,trump,"Normalcy is not what I would call the era that preceded Trump.

Obama did a great job rescuing the economy. The problem is that the recovery coincided with a rise in automation. While the economy was technically recovering and GDP was shooting up, a lot of factories simply weren’t hiring because they were having machines do the work. An economic recovery but still no job? Not normal at all. 

On top of this, the Democrats started doing more to appeal to voters on the east and west coast and seemingly forgot about the industrial Midwest, which is where I’m from and is home to many Democrats who are union workers. Combine the trend of automation with the Democrats no longer speaking to the folks in the rust belt, the stage was set.

Donald Trump and the Republicans came in in 2016 and filled this gap, speaking to these workers, making them feel heard, and ultimately motivating them to vote against their own economic interests.

Do the Democrats want to win again? They got to start speaking to the industrial Midwest. A lot of Trump voters aren’t bad people (some are), they just feel left behind and heard Trumps message of jobs and voted for him. My Uncle has been a Democrat his entire life and voted Trump. Do you think he really cares about the wall or the Mexicans or anything like that? Of course not. He heard that Trump would bring back jobs, so he voted for him. He’s a decent hardworking guy, and he just felt that the Democrats left him behind. We need to reach out to people like him and if we did, Trump would lose.

Specifically, I’m from Ohio. Despite Trump winning our state, Democrats like Sherrod Brown are very popular with us, simply because he embodies that notion of the old school, working class Democrat from the Rust Belt.

2093,trump,"Fox News has been calling the coronavirus a hoax until recently, downplaying it and supporting Trump's assertions that it's no worse than the flu, just a hoax, and overblown by ""Mainstream Media"" to make Predident Trump look bad. As a direct result of the misinformation they spread from their platforms where there's assumed to be a level of jouranlistic integrity and which many many people use as their sole source of news, there's a large segment of America which isn't taking the coronavirus seriously (and who are even actively flaunting precautions to show the ""libs"" made it up, or more recently to ""support the economy""). This misinformation by Fox is likely to directly lead to significantly more coronavirus deaths than necessary, as well as impede containment and actively spread the disease. There's also solid evidence that while Fox News pundits were telling people that coronavirus is a hoax, those at the network were aware of the danger posed by the virus and were actively taking steps to protect themselves and their family, steps which they were discouraging the public from doing and even implying that anyone silly enough to take such measures was buying into the MainStream Media hype and wants to hurt President Trump. 

Because they have a huge national platform to communicate directly with the public, as well as speak from a point of authority to many people and present themselves as news, their discouragement of coronavirus precautions and insistance that the coronavirus is a hoax/overblown could concerivably be contrued as at least Reckless Endangerment, and potentially Manslaughter. 

While much that Fox News (and of course other news outlets as well) isn't true and/or comes from a very politically biased point of view, that misinformation doesn't directly endanger individuals in the way that people are very tangibly endangered by being encouraged to behave in ways which will infect them with and spread a potentially deadly virus. They can't claim this misinformation came from a lack of knowledge, as there's ample evidence they were aware of the danger posed by the coronavirus, and instead downplayed it for strictly politcal reasons. 

It's not exactly similar, but is somewhat similar, to the idea people have Free Speech, but that doesn't involve speech which directly and knowingly endangers people, such as shouting ""fire"" in a crowded theater. It would be arguably different if the person who shouted ""fire"" legitimately thought there was a fire, even if there was none. However Free Speech doesn't protect intentionally endangering people if it's an informed decision (that is, if truth to the contrary is known) performed with malice (intend to mislead and harm). While this would be very difficult to litigate if it were one pundit or a rare thing, Fox almost across the board ran a literal campaign to convinve people to not take the coronavirus and related precautions seriously, and even insinuated that doing so was anti-Trump.

While they've since walked back some of what they claimed, it doesn't seem to have alleviated the problem and many Americans point to Fox News (and the President, who's immune to legal action so long as he's in office) as the source of their incorrect beliefs about the coronavirus.",1,1585611808

My point about LBJ was the number of roles he’d held before becoming president. There is a tendency to elect people as president who have 0 experience of federal government and then act shocked when they don’t know what they’re doing. Bush senior and ford both had I know (ignoring VP as that role depends on who you are VP too.... Cheney got the chance to run the country - Gore less so).

&gt; Justin Penn, a Pittsburgh voter who calls himself politically independent, favored Joseph R. Biden Jr. in a matchup with President Trump until recently. But the president’s performance during the coronavirus outbreak has Mr. Penn reconsidering.  “I think he’s handled it pretty well,” he said of the president, whose daily White House appearances Mr. Penn catches on Facebook after returning from his job as a bank security guard. “I think he’s tried to keep people calm,” he said. “I know some people don’t think he’s taking it seriously, but I think he’s doing the best with the information he had.”

&gt; Although Mr. Penn, 40, said he did not vote for Mr. Trump, his opinion of the president has improved recently and he very well might back him for a second term.

. . . 

&gt; Kathleen Mathien, an independent in Maricopa County, Ariz., said that she did not vote for Mr. Trump, but that her opinion of him had risen during his White House appearances to talk about the virus.  “He’s not one to be bullied,” she said, adding that she also saw flashes of empathy, a trait many critics find lacking in Mr. Trump.

&gt; Ms. Mathien, 64, a designer of cabinetry, explained that she doesn’t closely follow politics and finds it difficult to get a true understanding of candidates beyond the “smoke and mirrors” they project. “It’s so hard sometimes to vote if you don’t know who the real person is,” she said. Undecided as of now, she said Mr. Trump has a chance to win her vote.

. . . 

&gt; Robert Taylor, 31, a computer programmer in York County, Pa., wants Senator Bernie Sanders to be the Democratic nominee and is unsure if he will vote for Mr. Biden in a contest against the president.  “I’m not one of those people who hate Trump and thinks everything he’s done is wrong,” he said. He could vote for Mr. Trump if the president successfully leads the country through the coronavirus crisis, Mr. Taylor said. “We’ll see how he handles everything from here on out.”

&gt; Two months ago, Neil Ferguson of Earling, Iowa, stood in a corner for Senator Amy Klobuchar at Iowa’s Democratic caucuses. But he is displeased today by Democrats criticizing Mr. Trump’s leadership and wants the country to rally around the president at a time of national emergency.  “At some point we’ve got to get behind this together,” he said. “Every step of the way he’s criticized,” he said of the president. “I know a lot of voters out here that say yeah, had they given the guy a chance, maybe things would have been a lot better.”

&gt; Mr. Ferguson, 67, who is retired from the military, regularly watches the White House briefings, and though he sometimes winces over the president’s rambling delivery, he is impressed with Vice President Mike Pence and with Mr. Trump’s responses to reporters.  “When he gets to the question-and-answer period, he is pretty point-on,” he said. Four years ago Mr. Ferguson voted for a third-party candidate, but this year he has decided to vote for the president.

What's really, really frustrating is that the rally-behind-the-flag effect has all but vanished for Democratic presidents over the past 40 years.

This thing is spread through people's breath, so if we ALL cover up this will help prevent it from spreading.  If one infected person is on a train or bus and coughs or even breaths heavily they're putting that crap in the air and on every surface near them.  Anyone else comes in an touches then wipes face or mouth they now have it ... that's why I think it's going so crazy in NYC and other places with public transportation.  A bus driver in NYC videoed someone coughing on his bus, and the driver died weeks later after having it.  The thing is you can find science reports from months ago covering all this ... this administration fired most of the scientists in the cabinet and put his friends and financial backers into the positions.  They're not listening to the science.  How many times has Dr Fauci contradicted Trump, even to the point where Trump cuts him off.  It's sad how anyone can think Washington has played this thing well. 

The only way out of this is to tell everyone nation wide, wear masks or face coverings or you will be fined.

Trump: Wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, taking away health insurance from millions of people in the middle of pandemic. 

Biden: Wants to expand healthcare coverage, ensuring every American has insurance and if they can't afford that, public coverage. Supports free testing and care for Covid-19.

&gt;Separation of Church and State

Trump: has stocked his government with theocrats who oppose the separation of church and state.

Biden: Has a long track record as a devout Roman Catholic who doesn't make policy decisions based on his personal beliefs. Is a frequent target of Roman Catholic theocrats as a result of this.

&gt;Student Debt Reform

Trump: Has repeatedly supported predatory lenders and made it near impossible to get loan forgiveness during his administration.

Biden: Wants to make college more affordable or even free under some circumstances, wants to reform student loan payment to make repayment easier based on your income.

&gt;Net Neutrality

&gt; Income / class inequality
 
&gt; Higher minimum wage
 
&gt; Defeating Trump

Trump: opposes it.

Biden: supports it.

&gt;Getting big money out of politics.

Trump: Is hopelessly corrupt, openly accepts bribes.

Biden: [Has a plan to get big money out of politics.](https://joebiden.com/governmentreform/)

&gt;Environmental issues

Trump: Doesn't believe in climate change, wants to expand coal.

Biden: Believes in climate change, wants to replace coal with cleaner power, supports carbon taxes and will rejoin the Paris Agreement.

&gt; Abortion; pro choice
&gt; 
&gt; Gun control
&gt; 
&gt; Social Justice

Trump: opposes a woman's right to choose, has worked to end gun controls, and is a racist.

Biden: Has supported a woman's right to choose despite the attacks from his own religious community, a long-time supporter of gun control, and is a long supporter of minorities enthusiastic support from them in return.",4,1586375700

A few years ago, Payne went through all of the platforms by both the Republican and Democratic parties from 1980 until 2004. He identified every ""direct promise"" in those platform — pledges he thought amounted to concrete policy positions — and then compared those promises with all of the votes taken on either the House or Senate floor.""

Between his narcissism and his fear of being wrong, he's locked up, he's blue screened, he can't bring himself to act.

His fear of being wrong also means we get less air time from folks with actual knowledge (like Fauci) because Trump can't stand it when he says something and Fauci says something else and everyone listens to Fauci.",1,1586546400

However, the fact remains, the Trump campaign had numerous amounts of contacts with Russian officials during that time, making the investigation incredibly necessary.

Let us not forget that in the context of the war in Syria, Russia was aiding the enemy, making them an enemy of the state. Trump then aiding said enemy by withdrawing  from Syria allowing the Russians to have our newly vacated bases, and admitting defeat in a major proxy war signaling the USs weakened position to its enemies.

1. A cumulative graph that isn't normalized is going to necessarily look worse for a large country (China notwithstanding with likely bad data.)
2. This data is 8 days old. A lot has happened since then.
3. Confirmed data is effectively meaningless since there's no consistency globally in testing per capita or even test quality. Chinese tests are notoriously bad, and some countries are testing more per capita than others (easier to roll out testing in ROK than in France.)

For all the self-hatred we have here in the US, the US is actually testing more than most of the countries on this list except for Germany and ROK, but it's simply not enough to get actual population-level data when you're at 7000 per 1m or even 10k per 1m if the testing isn't RANDOM or at least a designed sample. 

And depending on how you parse the data, the US is flattening as well:

My opinion is anything less than universal health care, like how the GOP gutted ACA, will be done to kill it totally as a issue. I think we need a full reform, and of the two candidates, Biden gets us at least a White House that would not nakedly support their own interests.

If it pisses you off, and it should, vote in every election. Find local groups you believe in and support them. The fact we got Biden is because Sanders couldn't win key states. Why?

You can't expect people to vote for your values. People need to find their own values to vote for, that's the whole point of having your own vote to cast. If you put yourself in the shoes of someone who is saying that Biden isn't speaking to their concerns, why would I vote for him?

You're basically telling these people their main concerns don't matter. Imagine being told that your concern over the SCOTUS doesn't matter because surviving day to day matters more? How would you react to that? We can't guilt or force people to prioritize each other's own personal values. To you, the SCOTUS matters the most and to others, the basic necessities matter the most.

If Trump and the GOP maintain power, then the Court will be lost for a generation, with a high likelihood of an 7-2 conservative majority (plus Thomas and Alito would likely be pressured to retire to be replaced with younger conservatives to lock in their majority even longer).

My observation is that your political system has been so polarised by your media that many Americans no longer care about anything other than democrat vs republican. So in this case most republicans are willing to vote for the devil himself as long as he beats the democrats to the White House.

Republicans seem willing to defend the indefensible with Trump. Even though they clutched their pearls in horror over Bill Clinton’s conduct in office they are happy to ignore much worse conduct from Trump as long as he pretends to oppose abortion (c’mon, we all know he is responsible for quite a few!) and lets them keep their guns.

From the outside it looks less like a government of the people and more like a cult that is moving towards a dictatorship. Even if he is voted out in November I’m half expecting him to call foul and refuse to leave the White House.

As long as your news and social media outlets are allowed to lie without being held to account they will continue to convince the weak minded to vote for the devil.

#Vice President Joe Biden says:

&gt; **” As we prepare to reopen America, we have to remember what this crisis has taught us: The administration’s failure to plan, to prepare, to honestly assess and communicate the threat to the nation led to catastrophic results. We cannot repeat those mistakes.**

&gt;**We know what we have to do. We have the tools, expertise and, now, hard-won experience. The American people have already paid too high a price in illness, death and economic loss. This time, the White House has to get it right.”**

2674,trump,"I'll speak to your second point first. Sorry if that's a bit confusing.

The housing crisis wasn't caused by a bubble. The bubble was a symptom of the same underlying problem that caused the crash. Namely we made it too easy for people to get loans and the banks mitigated their risk by developing the variable rate loan, which in and of itself likely could've caused the crash. Unfortunately for the US economy, the variable rate mortgages were repackaged into bonds that could be purchased by investors. Since these were mortgage bonds they seemed like good investments even if they included risk. This could've crashed our economy on its own. Unfortunately, these bonds were fraudulently rated at a higher level than they would've been. Applying pressure to the ratings organizations, the banks succeeded in taking what were basically high-risk/return packages that should've been graded relatively low into A and AA bond stocks, lying to investors to further mitigate their risk. Then when the rates went up (or even when the high-risk debtors failed to pay) the mortgages dropped, followed by the servicing companies' holdings, followed by the investors, followed by the paper markets. Then bailout.

With that out of the way I have to say this:

Not every market is a rental market. Seriously. I'll use Austin, TX as an example. Unless you're building a pretty large multi-use development the housing market in Austin is absolutely terrible for ROI on rental properties. The best I've seen is a $300k property getting $2k/mo in rent. That's an 8% gross cap rate (which would usually result in a 4% net). That's a very poorly performing instrument when it comes to a rental property, especially because of the potential for catastrophe that you've mentioned in vacancy rates, repairs, taxes, etc. I would never own a rental home in Austin, TX (I actually do own a rental home in Austin but it wasn't purchased as a rental.) 

Now there are other cities where rentals can be very very lucrative. In St. Petersburg, FL, for example you can purchase a turn-key investment property for around $60k and rent that same property for $1,200/mo. Again, this is something I have experience with as I flipped houses there previously. This is a 24% gross cap rate, which will usually net you 12%. 

This is a good investment.

The issue here is that people will purchase these rental properties the same way investors purchased their bundled mortgages in 2000-2007. They think that ""residential real estate is a sure thing"" and they don't do their research. Some areas are great for flips (Austin!) some are better for rentals (Cleveland!) but non-savvy investors just buy where they are because they think a knowledge of the market and proximity to their property trump a good market. They're wrong, of course, unless they have excellent RE connections in their city but they think so nonetheless. Human nature.

What I'm saying is that these people made a poor investment and it's not really their tenant's responsibility to pay for that. 

Additionally this is just going to create problems for them moving forward. They're going to have a costly legal battle where they try to squeeze blood from a stone while being constantly derided by the judge for profiteering over a crisis (whether fairly or not) then, assuming they get the eviction and the court order to be paid back, they're just going to end up with a vacant property and a tenant that either simply ignores them and lets it on their credit or *maybe* one who pays over time in installments, usually very small installments. Meanwhile they get badmouthed on the internet, their property is renting for less than it was before the crisis (depressed rental market) and they've gained nothing except that which most landlords, if we're being honest, hold most dear: they get to feel vindicated. They *feel* like they were right. But that feeling isn't worth any $$$ and if they were smart investors they wouldn't pay thousands of dollars for it. Unfortunately, we already know that they're not smart investors from earlier in my response.

Hope this helps!

Oh, also while evictions are open in 60 days or so in most jurisdictions in the US it'll likely be MONTHS, possibly YEARS before their particular eviction is heard. The courts are going to be backed up like your uncle on the day after thanksgiving and they can't evict a tenant who's moved out already.",2,1586871118

&gt;(CNN)Former President Barack Obama will endorse Joe Biden on Tuesday, a source familiar with the plans tells CNN.

&gt;Obama will make the endorsement of his former vice president in a video message, offering why he believes Biden is the candidate needed at this moment of crisis in America, a person close to the former president says.

&gt;The endorsement reunites the former running mates and positions Obama, whose endorsement of Biden was seen as a forgone conclusion once Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the race last week, to be one of Biden's most powerful surrogates in the race against President Donald Trump.

&gt;It also marks the public re-emergence of Obama into the political arena. The former president kept a low public profile throughout much of the Democratic nomination fight, but he was active behind the scenes.

&gt;Two people familiar with Obama's video say it is intended as more than a simple endorsement of his friend and former vice president. His message is designed to address this particular moment in America and around the world, particularly in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

&gt;Obama will acknowledge how frightened people are and explain why he believes Biden is the right person to lead the country in this time of crisis, the sources said, and the candidate who must defeat Trump.

&gt;Obama will also speak directly to progressives, praising the spirit of their movement before outlining why he believes they should embrace Biden's candidacy. The former president will also offer a full-throated praise of Sanders and noting what his candidacy has meant for the pursuit of liberal ideals.

&gt;Obama in November said he had spoken to all of the candidates during the campaign, often giving them advice both before they announced their bid and after they dropped out. Advisers to the former president said his advice was often the same: Consider why you believe you should be president, what impact it will have on your family and whether you can actually win.

&gt;Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race

&gt;""We have a field of very accomplished, very serious and passionate and smart people who have a history of public service,"" Obama said at a private fundraiser in late 2019. ""Whoever emerges from the primary process, I will work my tail off to make sure they are the next president.""

&gt;Obama had long said he would get behind the eventual nominee, but the former president's deep affection for Biden was well known to all those who ran against the former vice president this year. Biden even jokingly posted an homage to Obama on ""Best Friends Day"" in 2019, featuring a friendship bracelet that featured the names ""Joe"" and ""Barack"".

&gt;That relationship, though, did not keep Obama from giving counsel to other candidates.

&gt;As Sanders worked to determine the future of his campaign, Obama and the Vermont senator spoke multiple times, a source familiar with the conversation told CNN. Sanders endorsed Biden on Monday in a livestream, pledging to help him defeat President Trump.

&gt;""We need you in the White House. I will do all that I can to see that that happens, Joe,"" Sanders said to Biden.

&gt;In the few moments where Obama did speak out about the race, the former president warned voters of worrying too much about the bruising nature of a primary, reminding them that he and then-Sen. Hillary Clinton had a tough primary in 2008.

&gt;And the former president told the candidates to avoid going so far left that they go beyond where voters actually are.

&gt;""My one cautionary note is I think it is very important for all the candidates who are running at every level to pay some attention to where voters actually are,"" Obama said in November, specifically saying he doesn't think candidates should be ""deluded into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven't heard a bold enough proposal.""

&gt;It is this period of the campaign, however, when some supporters of other candidates, especially Sanders backers, feel like their hopes were dashed once their candidates dropped out, where Obama's team believes the former president can be most useful.

&gt;""He is uniquely positioned to galvanize the party around the nominee and increase voter turnout so that a Democrat is successful in the general election,"" Valerie Jarrett, a longtime Obama adviser, told CNN in March.

&gt;Jarrett said that they believed it was ""important"" to let all the candidates ""stand on their own two feet"" but that once a nominee was selected, Obama would use the support he enjoyed from a ""a broad spectrum of the Democratic Party, both the progressive and moderate wings"" to bring the factions together.

&gt;Obama's popularity inside the Democratic Party was clear throughout the presidential campaign. A number of candidates ran ads featuring either images of Obama or the former president's voice, including Sanders, who had in the past been critical of Obama.

&gt;But the extent with which Obama can reach out to Sanders' supports is questionable, given many of the liberal leader's most vocal proponents see the former president as someone who squandered the movement he built in 2008. Even former Obama aides question how successful he will be in reaching Sanders' more diehard proponents.

&gt;Biden was not shy about his admiration for Obama throughout the 2020 campaign. Biden often described himself as an ""Obama-Biden"" Democrat and, in speeches across the country, would calmly refer to the former President as ""Barack,"" sometimes before correcting himself and calling him the president.

&gt;The former vice president even used part of his first major rally as a presidential candidate in 2019 to laud his former boss as ""an extraordinary man.""

&gt;""I watched up close, his character, his courage, his vision,"" Biden said. ""He was a president our children could, and did, look up to. ... He was a great president.""

Exactly. People don't realize that candidates who are perceived as ""extreme"" will drive people to the polls.... to vote for the other guy.  People, by and large, don't like change, especially older people and especially the moderate middle-of-the road types.  The safest thing Biden can do is to pick a moderate, or someone slightly to the left of him, and someone young. Mayor Pete and Beto fit the bill, but if he wants to mix it up, a woman like  Kamala, Amy Klobuchar, maybe even Gretchen Whitmer would be strong picks. Even Elizabeth Warren might be too far to the left for him.

And I say this as someone who agrees with Sanders's policies...

It is a vote that isn't going towards stopping the greatest existential threat to the progressive movement since Joseph McCarthy. 

There are 870 Federal judges in the US. Trump and McConnell have appointed 200 in the last three years, including two SCOTUS justices. They are asking older judges to retire early so they can be replaced with younge folks, just in case they lose in 2020. These are lifetime appointments. 

If we fail to beat Trump or take the Senate they will probably put another 250 judges into office. And not competent impartial judges who happen to he conservative, they're selecting Federalist Society stooges who make the Kochs proud. It'll give them a 30 year advantage in the judiciary. Maybe a 7-2 advantage in the Supreme Court which could last into the 2030s.

It'll be the death knell for any progressive agenda Bernie ever put forward. Think of all the shenanigans they could get away with.

Abortion is the first thing they'll go after, they literally promised to do so. But what about guns, all those blue state ""comon sense"" regulations, unconstitutional! LGBT discrimination, more like freedom of religion! Voter suppression, nahh nothing to see here. Gerrymandering is officially cool again.  What about a national ""right to work"", let's finish off labor unions once and for all. As for the constitutionality of healthcare reforms, uhh, whatever Aetna and Anthem want. Banking reform however is obviously wrong and will be stopped immediately. Intellectual property rights are clearly incredibly important. Right to repair, what js that? Justice reform? LMAO!

Hilary had the same issue. It was assumed that it was obvious that she was the better option over Trump. It seemed like she felt there was no need to win people over because they should simply vote for so Trump wouldn't win. And right now it seems like that is Biden's approach. 

The problem is everyone knows this, but a lot of people are tired of voting for the lesser of two evils. They don't want to vote for someone who is better than the other guy. They want to vote for someone they believe is genuinely going to be good for the country.

Stop it, you're hurting the election.

You're welcome to go through my profile.  I've never been right of anything in my life. 

&gt; 
&gt; You have no shame. For you, this is all about your elevated sense of self-importance.

That's yourself you're talking about.  You don't want to win, you want to be right.  If you wanted to win you'd stop attacking people who are already anti Trump.

Here's the lessons from 2016.

Attacking Bernie supporters is a bad idea

Saying you have to vote blue because Trump is so bad doesn't work.

Having no answer as to why I should vote for a candidate other than he's not Trump is a bad idea

No one wins but Trump for any of this.  You can't brow beat people into voting Biden, you have to make them want to vote Biden.  You can be upset that Bernie supporters want things you think are a bad idea that's fine.  But you can't sit here going ""Vote Biden or you're a monster"".  People don't respond to that.  You don't make them want to vote.

I swear to god, all any of you want is ""we were right now get in line and vote Biden""

That's not politics.

Go ahead, virtue signal at me all you want.  I'm part of the problem (even though I have no intention of voting Trump and have voted  blue every election in my life).

But say I wasn't already voting the way you want, you really think calling me a sociopath is the way to convince me?  Do you even actually want to convince me or do you just want to be right?  You know why the GoP wins?  Because they don't call people in their tent sociopaths.  They put in effort to keep them all in the tent.

I mean listen to yourself.  Someone goes ""I'm not sure I want to vote Biden, he's not great on a lot of my issues"" and your immediate response to these people is ""You're a sociopath and monster"".  Brilliant politics there.

And you call me the fake lefty and a kid.  Most childish point of view I've ever read out of you.  

But oh no you ""slayed"" me like the person who responded to you.  That's gonna feel good right until you realize you lost the election off of pushing people who would have voted with you away.",-3,1586967620
2783,trump,"I wouldn't be so sure about that. None of the things mentioned in this article will turn Republicans and right-leaning voters against him.

2785,trump,"&gt; I'm gonna vote for Biden, mainly because I believe he will do less damage than Trump. 

Please, if you haven't already, go read Biden's policy proposals. He has a platform that is probably 80% of what Bernie was proposing - huge investments in renewables and climate change mitigation, public health care option, canceling student debt and free college for people in need, new laws to protect and strengthen unions, etc.

Anyone who thinks a Biden vote is ""only"" a vote against Trump should go read more. Biden would literally be the most progressive president in US history if he wins.",2,1586971295
2786,trump,"I really have to ask, just like his use of the daily White House Coronavirus “briefing” to show what was a campaign video defending Trump’s incompetence, is this not entirely illegal? Using taxpayer money on toner to essentially send out what he hopes to be re-election fliers? How is this not a violation of the Hatch Act? The Treasury is not the President of the Vice President, so it nor its employees have immunity from engaging in political activities. 

When Trump gets beaten in November, I can only hope that in January of 2021 he is immediately arrested for the slew of crimes he has committed, New York State has some unfinished business with him.

Edit: words",18,1586971437
2787,trump,"Although I was excited to hear he was pushing for free college and canceling student debt, I personally feel the rest of his policies don't go  far enough. I don't think they will accomplish what America needs right now, but it will be less damaging to the country than what Trump would do.

At the very least I do appreciate your approach, and it's one I wish the party would use more. I see so many people virtually yelling at people who are undecided, calling them ignorant for not supporting Biden since he is better than Trump. Giving instances of his policies and goals will go a lot farther to appease the fears of the average voter more so than trying to guilt the vote out of them.

Unfortunately, posting them on his campaign page just isn't enough. They need to be discussed more. Sure his supporters may already know this, but those aren't the people that need to be reached. When someone says they are unsure or not going to vote, they need to be given a reason to want to vote, not ordered to fall in line.",1,1586973024

2799,trump,"We have to account that there is a decent amount of differences between now and 2016. Back in 2016, Trump for some was more like the Wildcard that people gambled on would be something different while Clinton may have been seen as more of the same of the Obama years (Which I'm sure isn't seen as a bad thing as most people here, but after 8 years it's fair to say people got complacent that they were fine with more Obama-like years while any anti-Obama sentiment fired up the right). And there's a decent argument that the gamble failed especially after not just impeachment but the response to the pandemic and the subsequent economic crash that came with it.

Biden is also more popular overall with the public and especially in rural areas then Hillary was, even if most of her hate was unfair and brought up from decades of false conspiracy theories it still had a impact. Whereas Biden has far less of that aside from the Trump campaign's attempt to paint Burisma as such... which only serves to remind people of what he was impeached for.

The democratic party is for more united now to defeating Trump, back in 2016 there was a complacency that Hilary was going to beat Trump easily. Now, pretty much all Democrats will be on alert and fired up to do all they can to vote Trump out. (And there will be a decent slew of independents and Never Trump republicans to back them up too)

And even considering 2016, it was a very close electoral score that if even just a few hundred thousand had swung elsewhere in the swing states from Trump this subreddit would be talking about Hillary's re-election chances. Considering Biden is a more popular and stronger candidate then Hillary is at the moment, that may be enough of it's own but of course he is working to making the argument for electing him even stronger by giving an olive branch to all Democrats who supported the other candidates by either offering their candidate a job at the white house (Secretary of State, Department of Education, etc.) or adopting policies similar to other candidates",1,1586976326

It also is impossible to have an honest conversation about concerns we might have about the nominee and wanting to make sure we can beat trump and not screw working people. I want to defeat trump, and the best way to do that is to pressure the nominee to adopt policies that will appeal to the people who feel disenfranchised by both parties. We don't need to convince blue no matter who people. We need to bring in people who care about the integrity of the candidate. And if you can't find anything to speak to the candidate's integrity, then there are other things to talk about.

&gt;

&gt;Former Vice President Joe Biden

&gt;’s campaign is planning a rollout for Michelle Obama

&gt;’s endorsement, although there are questions around just how public a role the enormously popular former first lady will play in his campaign.

&gt;Sources tell The Hill that the Biden campaign’s early plans include a focus on remote fundraising and voter registration efforts.

&gt;The trick for Michelle Obama and the Biden campaign is finding the right balance for the pop culture icon, who could be a massive asset for the campaign but has never shown much enthusiasm for campaign politics.

&gt;A source close to Michelle Obama said the former first lady would likely get her own moment to spotlight her support for Biden, after giving at least a week for her husband’s endorsement to be at the forefront.

&gt;“The Biden campaign will take anything they can get from her. The question is, as a family matter, what kind of profile does she and her husband and her daughters want her to have?” said Howard Gutman, a former Obama administration ambassador. “It’s a question of how much they want her to be out there in the crossfire.”

&gt;Sources tell The Hill that Obama is expected to lend her name to an email fundraiser, potentially as early as next week. She may also lend her image to a direct mail campaign, while continuing the voter registration efforts she has spearheaded as the founder of a nonpartisan nonprofit group.

&gt;In addition, there are talks about the former first lady potentially filming a short online video in support of Biden that has a lighter tone than the one former President Obama filmed for his endorsement earlier this week.

&gt;The campaign would also like Michelle Obama to pop in from time to time on virtual fundraisers, and Democrats expect she will work the phones behind the scenes, encouraging her celebrity friends and fundraisers who may have backed other candidates in the primary to rally behind Biden.

&gt;The sources say the details and timing are still being ironed out.

&gt;Political observers say the Obamas provide the one-two punch Biden needs to help rally Democrats as he seeks to address an enthusiasm gap against President Trump

&gt;. The former president's endorsement on Tuesday received more than 1 million views in the first 39 minutes it was posted, according to Twitter data.

&gt;Michelle Obama actually has a far higher favorability rating than her husband, in addition to being the author of the best-selling memoir of all time. Her book “Becoming” sold 10 million copies in the four months after it was released.

&gt;“Some might say Michelle Obama is the more popular Obama,” said one source familiar with the endorsement. “She's the one with the blockbuster book.”

&gt;A source said that Michelle Obama “has an incredible soft spot for Joe,” and their families have remained close since leaving the White House.

&gt;Democrats expect Obama will do more for Biden than she did for Hillary Clinton

&gt;in 2016. That year, she gave an electric speech at the Democratic National Convention, where she memorably rolled out the “when they go low, we go high” line that has become her political mantra.

&gt;The first lady did make public appearances on behalf of Clinton, although mostly in the waning days of the campaign.

&gt;Despite her popularity, Obama has resisted calls to run for office or to be on the front lines campaigning, underscoring her apparent distaste for election politics.

&gt;Democrats who have worked with her on political campaigns say she’s happy to do her part, but also note that she seems to have little interest in the fundraising and glad-handing aspects of it.

&gt;“She hates campaigning and fundraising with a passion,” said one Biden fundraiser. “She hates dealing with donors, hates the bullshit political side of things and how fake it all is, and she thinks of it as a time suck. It’s the single number one reason she won’t run for office, even though no matter what office she’d run for, she’d win.”

&gt;The most natural spot for Obama could be on the voter registration side, where she launched a group in 2018 called “When We All Vote,” along with Tom Hanks, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Janelle Monáe, Chris Paul, Faith Hill and Tim McGraw. She will lead a virtual event for the group on Monday as part of an effort to encourage voters to take advantage of mail and absentee balloting during the coronavirus pandemic.

&gt;The group is ostensibly nonpolitical, and a spokesperson told The Hill they are working to register voters of all political stripes, despite the Obamas recently having endorsed Biden.

&gt;“When We All Vote is a non-partisan, nonprofit organization and our focus will continue to be increasing participation in every election,” said Crystal Carson, a spokeswoman for the group. “We want every eligible voter to be registered and ready to cast their ballot, no matter their background.”

&gt;While many Democrats expect Obama will largely remain above the political fray, they also said not to underestimate the lengths she’ll go to get Biden elected and to protect her husband’s legacy.

&gt;“She may not like politics, but also Donald Trump has dissembled everything her husband tried to accomplish,” said Dick Harpootlian, the former Democratic Party chairman of South Carolina and a Biden supporter. “If she engages, God help Donald Trump, because she’s tough as nails and enormously popular.”

&gt;“She may not be out there breathing fire on the campaign trail,” Harpootlian added. “But she’ll be firm, and she’ll explain why Trump is not fit to be reelected and can synthesize her support for Biden in a digestible way.”",1,1587068808
2865,trump,"No one is arguing any of that. We are talking about people saying we are parroting GOP ""alternate history,"" when referring to Trump being the president. Whether we like it or not, whether its fair or not, the orange bastard, **BY DEFINITION,** was *""elected.""* and is now our president. Whether its fair or not is an entirely different conversation.

2866,trump,"Trump is now a heavy underdog and he knows it. That's why he is placing bets on longshots, hoping that one will pay off and propel him to victory:

1. Hydroxychloroquine: If (against most current evidence) it turns out to actually be a very effective treatment that slashes the death rate, Trump can (somewhat legitimately) claim to have been ahead of the curve and ""the experts"".
2. China as villain: Suppose evidence comes to light that China not only covered up relevant information, but maybe even let it spread to other countries on purpose? Low probability, but a bonanza for Trump if shown to be true.
3. ""The cure is worse than the disease"": If the debate can be framed as ""*Democrats want to keep things shut down and keep YOU (unemployed/underemployed voter) impoverished and desperate*"", then Trump might win an unexpected windfall of votes from those who might otherwise default to Biden.
4. ""It killed less people than the flu"". Of course, this is illogical, because (if it turns out to be true), it was only because of the extraordinary measures that we took, that we never take for the flu, and it happened in the spring and not the winter. But will a pissed-off voter parse these fine distinctions?

For one, he’s never proven he’s a billionaire as most, if not all billionaires readily provide actual proof they are.

He called himself a billionaire years ago, before anyone even mentioned it. Even then, what records were available showed he was far from being one. He was in debt far greater than anyone had seen.

When asked for proof of his wealth, he blew it off. That’s a fact.

Most billionaires have had rough patches, but trump has filed for bankruptcy so many times, it’s ridiculous. 

There is no way on God’s green Earth he’s one. He’s pulled the wool over his supporter’s eyes and they readily believe him. 

He hasn’t released his tax returns and no...it doesn’t take 7 years and counting to do an audit. What is he hiding? The truth about him. That’s what.

Other wealthy people open their books because they aren’t afraid of showing what they control and own.

How much would Warren help Biden in swing states vs a woman from a swing state? Serious question: what would Stacey Abrams do for African-American turnout in and outside the South? More specifically/narrowly, how popular is she in Florida? That's a serious question meant mostly for people in Florida and Georgia.

2883,trump,"Trump will likely emerge as the worst of the OECD leaders for this, but I think it bears noting that on a per capita basis, everywhere has kinda done shitty here and we shouldn't just be looking at our failures.

France has more confirmed cases per capita than we do with LESS testing. Belgium has more confirmed cases with a little more testing. Italy and Spain as well. The Netherlands is around the same as us.

It bears noting only because we cannot learn ONLY the lesson that Trump failed (he did) but that nobody got it ""right"" either. Once he's (hopefully) out, we can't just assume that competent leadership means no more cases or issues. This disease isn't easy to stop, and the fact that so many other competent governments have failed is proof of that.

Trump will likely end. This disease will last years more. Let's learn from his failures and also learn why nobody else seems to have succeeded.",1,1587093237
2884,trump,"2016 was a failure in selecting an electable nominee.  The specific results weren't particularly predictable, but a replacement-value Democratic nominee wins that race almost every time.  Trump had roughly net -15 favorability for almost the entire race and Clinton had roughly net -10; someone at a nice flat 0 would have won in a blowout.

FWIW Biden has much better favorability numbers than Clinton, but Trump's numbers are also up relative to 2016.",1,1587093472

I'm impressed that that band of idiots came up with it so quickly.

After seeing children ripped away from their mom's - many of whom will never find them again, and the angry, defiant defenses from Trumpers for this act, it's just gone downhill from there. 

I won't go down the litany of crimes - both legal and moral - that Trump and his people have committed since then. We all know them. 

After all of this and now their defense of his declarations this week of complete and total authority over states and the Senate, it's over. I don't think there's any way I can ever forgive them for not just enabling, but cheering on as Trump's overseen the destruction of the country I fought for in two wars.

You’re missing the point: every Western democracy seems to have been unable to control this— even in Germany it’s not sure why they didn’t get hit hard. It’s not entirely clear. 

Yes, we failed. But if the outcome is the same whether we did x, y, or z then we need to figure out what’s next. This is only wave 1 of many. 

I hate to break it to you but this is going to happen again. And again. And again. Until a vaccine happens up to (and likely) 50-60% of the population will get this no matter what. That’s just inevitable. It won’t slam like it did before but it’ll continue spreading until there’s fewer people to infect. 

We can’t say that these other countries figured it out for sure given that we’ve got many more future waves ahead of us.

If you look at the ventilator issue it isn't BS.  The ventilators have been ordered since 2009 under Obama.  They commissioned a small Japanese company called Newport to design a simpler one that cost a fraction of a standard one.  They were forwarded millions.  Then a bigger ventilator company purchased them and cancelled that model and order.  The federal commission waved that through.  They simply didn't want a cheaper ventilator cutting into their profits.    


Had that not happened it would still have been several years before the ventilators on order would have been delivered.  


Under Trump they ordered from a Dutch company around 2017 but they haven't been delivered yet.  Some sources say the middle of this year but others say 2022-23.    


This isn't about whether Obama or Trump is to blame for the stockpile lacking but how corporations not wanting competition wasted years of govt time and also millions of govt money.

Forget China. They are not the World Health Organization and it’s not their job to educate the US. Pointing out China’s numbers will not raise our dead. And the most important point is that the US numbers are also suppressed. Covid-19 deaths are being labelled as “pneumonia” because as long as you don’t test them post-mortem you don’t have to write Covid-19 on the death certificate.

Trump is pointing at China simply to deflect from his own failings. It seems he is happy to foment a civil war to deflect also. A year from now, someone will lay down the number of death certificates issued in the US vs the same period last year and we will see the “real” number.",1,1587298263

Aso if you watch this video carefully-it looks like this to me:

Pence came on the show planning on giving a statement. He had it memorized and just wanted to rattle through. The 2nd time the host asks the question, pence looks visibly angry (at the host for asking the question, but also, I believe at trump for this latest, very serious mess that trump caused because he simply doesnt understand the gravity of his actions and that he now has to clean up). He jokes it off, saying something along the lines of every american knows nobody is more excited to open america up than the president. Then continues with his prepared statement.

He was literally known as the democrat that had experience but man was he always “that guy” that would say something to put a foot deep in his mouth. If you look at his previous presidential runs, and have access to the commentary around that time, none of it ever took joe seriously. 

The fact now, he was the choice of the majority, is  telling how not only weak the big names in the party are, but how diverge the basis is (which is good). 

As a Canadian I am far more happy with a Biden than a Sanders or a Trump. Biden will be great for trade for us, won’t play around with the USMCA, will be predictable on foreign policy, etc etc. But beyond the advantages for Canadians to have Biden down south, I still find it amazing how a lot of Democrats convinced themselves that Biden is actually a quality candidate. 

I do hope he wins, but let’s be honest and call a spade a spade: he has trouble speaking, he is often nonsensical in his replies (which is a continuation of the trump presidency he too makes no sense), he is old as dust (but then again most “top tier” democrats were in this race), he literally made it this far because he was the VP of Obama (though he does have experience but none of that experience mattered in his previous attempts until he had the VP check next to a historical figure), his best presidential moments have been due to how easily it can be juxtaposed to the current presidential train wreck, he has a track record that is not the greatest (but then again most politicians that have been that long in the game so, so not unique). 

Anyways. I am curious however, why democrats (even those part of Democrats abroad here in Canada), get so upset when this is brought up? I have had this conversation, and they actually believe he is good. Nothing wrong with say “look he is pretty bad but Bernie is too left for me and he won’t get stuff done. I wanted a known value, he was so much around Obama and that means something for me, and he knows how govt works despite his checkered policy past at least he won’t try to run it like a business”.",1,1587476596

It really is time for ‘war’ with the Republicans. The only metric Americans respect is ‘strength’. It’s a sad truth. Intelligence - forget it. Experience - waste of time. ‘Strength’ is the only factor Americans care about. Now mind you it’s not moral courage or actual strength. It’s a fighting spirit. You can be a coward like Trump who can’t even fire someone face to face but as long as you project ‘strength’ you will win. This explains Trump’s toddler-like need to repeat the words ‘strong’ and ‘powerful’ and ‘greatest/biggest/most/best’ ad nauseum. 

This also explains the frustration Democrats have trying to explain policy. Controversial point - Americans rarely give a damn about policy. This is why working class Americans continually vote against their own self interest.

Because, you know, some people out there are saying, and I’m gonna tell you, you know, my grades, they were something else. You know, a lot of people are still talking about my grades bc I was the only person in college that had a 102 on every single test they ever took. I mean, I got 100 of course, bc of this big giant brain of mine. But I got one point added for being so well dressed, and one point added for being so good looking . That’s it. Even the men teachers in college did that. Can you believe that? I mean, I don’t know if they were homos or not, might be. But maybe not bc I’m that good looking. I am. A lot of people are saying that. This head isn’t just a hat rack you know. In addition to having the best looking face ever in the history of men, there’s a big giant brain in there. Probably the bilgiest brain there ever would is or won’t be. I’m serious. A lot of people are talking about my big brain and my brain is the reason the economy is doing so great. “How’s your 401k?”  That’s what I always say.  And you know, the reason I love the 401k is because the gays can’t have one. That’s what a 401k means - it’s not for the gays. Because I don’t like gays. I think they are gross. Not as gross as democrats, but gross. I just think homos shouldn’t exist. But boy I love Jesus. Yeah I’m a super big Christian. Read my bible every day. In fact, some people even say I’m God. You know, I’m not gonna say that. I’m not gonna say I’m God. You can if you want. But I’m not gonna do it. I’m not gonna say I’m God. I’m not gonna -  not say it either.

Science does say a baby is a fetus before it's born, and a bunch of cells and an embryo long before that. That's it, and all anyone in the Democratic party claims. The pro-choice argument is one that says a woman has a right to decide what to do with her and her bodily autonomy. It is not ""Dems say science says abortion is morally ok.""  

I'm a huge skeptic and we Democrats have our own pet issues that are really bad science (as a party we tend to be a little too scared of Nuclear power and buy into the 100% fabricated nonsense that is homeopathy and being anti-GMO more than your average Republican), but those two issues aside, no dude, the Democratic party is the party that generally accepts science on essentially every important issue when the Republican party is anti-science as a platform. Like, literally. 

They refuse to let the CDC study gun deaths.  
They want to defund public broadcasting and free childrens education for poor families. 
They want religious opinions to Trump the scientific consensus in textbooks regarding evolution, homosexuality, and the age of the goddamned earth itself. 
They want schools to pretend gay people don't even fucking exist. 
THEY DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE MAN-MIND CLIMATE CHANGE AS REAL, LET ALONE A PRESSING ISSUE.

People willingly accept injections containing disinfectants all the time. Most vaccines contain one or more disinfectants (see CDC link below ""Vaccine Ingredients"")

Notice there are many vaccines that contain one or more of the following: formaldehyde, alcohol, Phenol. All are disinfectants.

This information is not a surprise. It’s the fundamental pillar of their entire strategy. All the misinformation and attempts to shape public opinion so blatantly. 

It started with Steve Bannon and World of Warcraft. He realized there exists a population of people who feel like they aren’t good enough or the world is screwing them over. This original group was the Incels on World of Warcraft. 

Bannon realized these people would manipulate their reality in order to make themselves look better to others, and feel better about themselves. After all, pretending, lying or fabricating a whole life story is pretty easy anonymously on the internet. 

So he created Cambridge Analytica. This combined with existing misinformation systems, namely Russian Internet Agency, was a great weapon to manipulate people into achieving your own goals.

The only surefire way to convince Trump voters to abandon him is for them to feel like he's abandoned them. Unfortunately, COVID-19 may well have that effect by virtue of killing tens of thousands of people.

As much as I want stay-at-home orders to remain in effect until the threat is manageable, the political consequence of a secondary or even tertiary spike in the death toll is that voters likely to make an emotional decision in the voting booth will feel abandoned. It shouldn't take a massive death toll to make these folks see reality, but I don't think any other threat can have that effect.

THAT’S what gets me the most, is that pre-Trump, anyone going off-message (either side) even remotely as much as he does (and did, all through the election) would be dead in the water within a month...

By which I mean I’m pretty sure that they would automatically lose 10% of their support (and some real measure of enthusiasm, however you want to measure that), simply for being perceived as being too random, or a poor leader simply because of that lack of “messaging strength”.

But not Trump. He says random, contradictory shit all the time, and his base loves him all the more, despite it - or maybe because of it, hell if I know which.

Nothing makes sense with how Trump “defies gravity” as they used to say a couple years ago - that the rules of political don’t seem to apply to him at all.

Trump says up is down, and suddenly a shockingly high number of other republican ‘electeds’ and other political appointees have to agree up is down (all evidence to the contrary), or else their own political futures are suddenly *seriously* in doubt.

In April 1998, President Bill Clinton read a  Richard Preston novel, ""The Cobra Event,"" about a biological attack on  the U.S. using a lethal virus that spreads like the common cold.

""It  scared the bejesus out of him,"" recalls Kenneth Bernard, a now retired  U.S. Public Health Service official who was then representing the U.S.  in Geneva at the World Health Organization.

Clinton  set the wheels of government in motion, and the result was the first  federal government effort to marshal resources in preparation for a  pandemic, including the creation of the National Emergency Medical  Stockpile, which stowed vaccines and medical gear in secret locations  around the country. Bernard was appointed as the first official on the  National Security Council whose sole job was to focus on health threats.

\[...\]When President George W. Bush took office in  2001, Bernard wrote a transition memo. He soon learned the Bush team had  eliminated his job as White House biodefense czar.

""They just threw the memo away, and said, 'This is not a national security issue. This is one of those Clinton things.'""

\[...\]During  the transition from Obama to Trump, Obama officials conducted a  tabletop exercise based on a pandemic with incoming Trump aides. But in  his second year as president, Trump fired his top official in charge of  pandemic response, Tom Bossert, and did not replace him. Trump then  allowed his national security adviser to disband the NSC's global health  unit. As a result, when alerts about coronavirus began to emanate from  the intelligence and public health communities, there was no senior  official in the White House to coordinate a response.

\[...\]In  2007, a journal published by the American Society for Microbiology  included an article that warned about the potential for a  epidemiological ""time bomb"" if a new strain of coronavirus emerged from  wild animals in a Chinese ""wet market,"" where vendors slaughter live  animals for customers. COVID-19 is believed to have originated in such a  market.

""Coronaviruses are well known to undergo genetic recombination, which  may lead to new genotypes and outbreaks,"" said the study, whose lead  author, Vincent C.C. Cheng, is among the leading researchers in Hong  Kong studying COVID-19. ""The need for preparedness should not be  ignored.""",1,1587925563

""I asked Bill a question that probably some of you are thinking of, if you're totally into that world, which I find to be very interesting. So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous—whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light—and I think you said that that hasn't been checked, but you're going to test it. And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way, and I think you said you're going to test that too. It sounds interesting…
And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning. Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that. So, that, you're going to have to use medical doctors with.

In such cases it's natural to have nihilistic thoughts that second guess our convictions. For example thinking: _'it's a waste of time to stay on the high road.'_

I know the reflex very well myself, and people have pointed it out to me when I've done it. I think of it as the nihilistic reflex that comes with caring about a relatively structurally violent society. When that happens you know you have what it takes, because compassion is not supposed-to be fun in the presence of structural violence. 

Frustration is justified but doesn't get anything done, so we can choose to become one of them, give-up and go away, or get back on the high road. The reason I stay on the high road is because I believe it's the only way to progress. I know there's only one love that will defeat hate, and one rationality that will defeat ignorance. 

I do see a light at the end of the tunnel, but it's quite far away and dim.  
 
When I was a kid it was rare to find an anti-racist and pro-feminist white male, whereas now there are millions. I see that as progress in my lifetime, but Trump represents social dysfunction in the USA that grew over those decades as well.

I know the feeling of wanting to hold the world on ones shoulders, but the dysfunction that is happening today is not something that we can address directly as individuals, but something that takes collective organization. That stress you feel personally that makes you want to meet republicans on their own moral level is misplaced since the power of individuals is limited.  

The light at the end of the tunnel I see is that each generation of U.S. working-class youth seems to get more skeptical of the status quo then the previous generation. I think helping to make things a little better for each generation of activist is a way we create a light in that tunnel. I find thinking in the long-term relieves some of the frustration I have over how polarized and reactionary the USA has become in the last 20 years.

The rest of the country getting fucked is a bonus fetish for Mitch.  He presents his argument suggesting that blue states would use further funding to prop up any failing pension funds, which KY happens to be in one of THE worst cases with our pension funding.  Louisville and perhaps Lexington/Frankfort have been ordered to make all kinds of budgetary cuts in order to help the rest of the state's failing pension funding.  It has been mismanaged for years and now all the blue parts of the state are paying the price for it in hotly contested budget proposals every year.

Trump shut down the country like any other country should, however the virus was well already spreading throughout the nation, state governors idk for what reason didn’t shut down their state borders, issues strict enforcement on mask wearing, curfews, etc...heck even in my state of Connecticut(one of the most infected states out there), people here still continue to go out to the stores without masks or gloves, there’s no strict curfew, law enforcement isn’t doing anything to enforce such regulation(not their fault considering they only have to follow orders and if no orders are given what else can they do?), etc... Again I’m not trump supporter and I certainly won’t be voting for him in the next election, but in regard to the outbreak of the virus, there wasn’t much else he could’ve done. He shut down the country when the number of infected were still very low, yet states at the time didn’t issue any type of strict enforcements to limit the spread (like closing off state borders), and now look at the situation wer in now. And now there’s even state governors like that in Texas who are calling to end the lockdown and these anti-lockdown protestors don’t even care whether they get the virus much less anyone else. I’m very much aware of Trump’s incompetence in general and his tone/speeches aren’t saving face either, but overall in reality there wasn’t much he else he could’ve done and I also blame state government for not doing much in the initial outbreak stages either to limit the spread.",1,1588039162

**Bullshit point number 1**

""Automobiles cause 38,000 deaths a year""

This generalization fails to mention **how**. Some of these numbers include *but are not limited to*

&gt;driving while intoxicated or under the influence, intentional or unintentional manslaughter, vehicle malfunction, operator error, road hazards, inclement weather, personal health failure 

So you've lumped together more than six or seven different fucking categories under ONE umbrella. It is the equivalent of counting all the war fatalities in history under ""anyone who ever died without intending to die.""

All of a sudden that number is more impressive. By your logic, **we should just hold Trump responsible for every medical related death in America**

Eh, fine by me. Might as fucking well


**bullshit point number 2**

These numbers are non equivalent 

Covid 19 55,000/90 days= 611 Americans per day (ITS NOT FUCKING DONE. STOP PUTTING A BOW ON THIS GOD DAMN THING)

Car Fatalities 36,000/365 Days= 98 Americans dead per day


**Bullshit point number 3**

The implied ""We just let those other deaths happen and dont care""

*Fucking what?* no. I care. Nobody should die from murder, preventable or even preventable diseases (we should be actively trying to cure or MAKE them preventable!) and ideally fatal accident prevention exists for a reason. God damn.

However, I still can’t get over the fact of how several states, up to this point aren’t taking stricter means into limiting the spread of this virus, as I mentioned in my previous post about my state and other states across the country such as Texas. I agree with you in every sense, we are the biggest superpower in the world now, and seeing our current situation whilst during a time where we have one of the most incompetent leaders in American history, our global image if it wasn’t low before it certainly is now. We should’ve been planning for this long before the 1st official case had been reported here in the US. There might’ve been plans but it’s certainly wasn’t enough. What we need now more than ever is a leader who addresses the current situation with strictness and enforcement, instead of playing the blaming game and gloating whilst people are dying. This is why we have those anti-lockdown protestors and even state governors calling for an end to the lockdown. All in all, I’m not saying trump doesn’t have his own part in responsibly in this situation, he certainly does. Again like I mentioned, state government also have the blame for not taking stricter actions in the initial outbreak, and especially now when the spreading of the virus is more dangerous than ever.

Trump could’ve created a national shelter-in-place order, which would have superseded any decisions by any governor to keep their state open, or any other half-assed measure.

Yes, it’s not his direct intention, but his criminal negligence could still end up with genocide as a result.

Democrats have been threatened. Muslims have been threatened. Jews have been threatened. Mexicans have been threatened. Asians have been threatened.

I might be wrong on this, idk, I’m just trying to in a sense give my own point of view in regards to the state I live in. I agree with you trump should’ve been a “real” leader from the start and definitely should’ve acted like one. Months are continuing to pass, yet states still don’t try to take stricter actions in containing the spread of the virus. Despite if Trump isn’t taking necessary action, states to this day aren’t taking necessary guidelines or taking drastic measures into contains the virus, nothing is stopping them from doing so now.

Lets be honest, repealing EPA regulations or raising poor/middle class taxes (with a few years delay) does harm people, but the number of steps or the number of years removed the people are who are being harmed are from how it do that harm makes it much less salient as opposed to watching your grandparents die, or your friends grandparents die, or watching as other countries come out of shelter in place weeks/months before us because they had competent leadership and adequate preparations this sort of event.

Tail risk is real, but for most of us tail risk only becomes salient when you get some personal level of exposure to the fallout of one of those risks being realized from time to time.

Look, you don't need to invent stats to say Trump has fucked up. But there are alot of critizism that pretty much could be extended to the rest of the planet aswell.  


Lack of screening in airports. There was research done during the SARS epidemic with regards to screening in Canada, a country that suffered relativly much from SARS. The conclusion was that screening in airports is in large ineffective and can have negative effects by giving false securities while not actually preventing any spread to speak of. What countries screened heavily?   


Comparisons with other Viruses. Well, you cannot make these comparisons. I don't think it is fair to claim SARS response was much better, its just a different virus with less capabilities of spreading. Swine flu actually infected more people than this, just killed far less. Oficiall infection rate was 1.6 million but studies claim they where morelikely 100s of millions.   
And Ebola? really? it spreads through feces, blood and vomit. naturally a global outbreak is quite alot easier to avoid than with droplet spread.  


Zika spreads through a tropical mosquito, again not comparable.

Swine flu is H1N1. Or it is a H1N1 virus. The only other pandemic of that virus is the Spanish flu afaik, we definitely did not stop that.  


Stop making claims that we did a better job with these, they where obviously easier to handle and in some cases not really prevented at all, we just let them burn themselves out.

None of those state leaders fired their pandemic teams that were embedded in the source of the contagion.

Also- and this is your most serious oversight here- each of those states have different geographical and environmental conditions.

Person-to-person infection depends on freedom of movement.

For example, Italy has much higher infection rates than neighboring Switzerland. This is because of the large mountain landscape that borders between the two.

China is predominantly a flatbed continent with low sparse mountains. The country doesn't have the Danube River or the Black forest, as in Europe. So the virus can shift across the land without buffers like sand being blown across smooth stone.

There are other issues as well from country to country. At the time the virus was discovered, China was entering it's Spring Festival where millions migrate back home for the New Year.

In the states, the country literally moves across from West to East through train and plane. Also, as a service economy, there are more gatherings that local commercial industries depend on.

Another factor is universal healthcare. Each country has different healthcare resources. In the US with privatised healthcare, people are less financially sound to get check.

In the UK, we have the NHS where medical screening  is more accessible.

These are the factors involved that shape each state's response. But the decisive factor *that allowed a pandemic to spread* was Trump removing the prevention.

&gt;I'm not arguing that Trump did a good job. I'm arguing that even countries that responded like Belgium have seen challenges.

That's literally a defence of Trump's lack of response.

&gt;The point is that you can do things RIGHT with this and still get screwed.

I refer to the above.

&gt;Stop being sanctimonious for a second and realize that you can be on the same side and still want to discuss beyond just nodding and circle jerking how great you are for hating Trump. 

As hominem. 

&gt;I hate Trump and think he failed miserably, but....

Yeh, that ol' chestnut.

&gt;I also think we need to understand why most of the OECD failed if we're going to do better with the next one. 

Because Trump fired the prevention teams because of his Obama-hate.

&gt;Then Trump dismissed the NSC pandemic team and the CDC officer in China training the CCDC in preventing epidemics.

&gt;What does this matter for all the other OECD countries though? They didn't do that. And they're suffering all the same. 

They didn't with Ebola *(which you said is more deadly)*. Or H1N1. Or the SARs. Or the Bird Flu. Why? Because the CDC officer was stationed in Beijing until Trump.

&gt;Different variables, same outcome. 

Which you're ignorant of to change the narrative.

&gt;From an epidemiology perspective, you have to figure out WHY the outcomes are the same with or without Trump.

But Trump still had the effect.

&gt;Please don't just be sanctimonious. 

And hominem

&gt;Understand that I think Trump failed, but I also think we ALL (meaning every country) need to learn what worked and what didn't. 

Trump. Trump made it not work. What would've work would have been if he left the NSC pandemic team alone and not fired CDC officer.

&gt;For instance, why is Singapore now seeing a huge uptick despite early success? 

Because there's a virus. Because Trump dismissed the prevention methods.

&gt;Why couldn't any of Europe seemingly keep it under control despite strong and generally competent government and bureaucratic apparatuses?

Universal healthcare, geography, environment, infrastructure and factors.

&gt;These are all relevant questions for the future. Trump is not. He'll either be dead or gone.

But he still removed the resources that could have prevented this pandemic.",1,1588091503
3512,trump,"But this wasn’t really unprecedented:
- The H1N1 Pandemic of 1918
- SARS (Coronavirus)
- MERS (Coronavirus)
- The H1N1 Pandemic of 2009

It’s important to note that The H1N1 Pandemic of 1918 is misnamed “The Spanish Flu” because every country EXCEPT Spain ignored/hid the local Epidemic. tRump did the EXACT same thing that lead to this pandemic being as bad as it was. 

In lessons learned from the H1N1 Pandemic of 2009, Obama built-up the CDC, established pandemic monitoring groups, established remote monitoring groups, increased stockpiles, etc. The tRump Administration AND TRUMP HIMSELF were briefed on the treat and all preparations. tRump dismantled all of the Obama Era preparations and stockpiles — and bragged about it. It’s on video tape. 

tRump and his Administration were briefed in Nov 2019, in Dec 2018, in Jan 2020, in Feb 2020 and they CHOSE to ignore, minimize and denigrate responses and calls to action. When they couldn’t ignore and/or sweep things under the rug any more, the implemented a racist and ineffective “appeal to the base” response. 

They banned asian nationals, completely ignoring the fact that US national returning from potentially infectious area would be carriers. They ignored vectors from Europe. When they finally (too late) responded to vectors from Europe, they gave a pass to the UK (Boris Johnson is the tRump of Europe). 

When offered tests, etc. from the WHO, he passed to arrange flow through companies owned by family, friends and donors. When shortages were painfully apparent, he delayed to arrange flow through companies owned by family, friends and donors. This is ALL documented. 

tRump’s response was, and continues to be, an arrogantly ignorant, racist, protect/pad my fragile ego, line my own pockets, response. He dismantled a working system. He ignored all the experts and made decisions that RESULTED is needless deaths, illness, damage to the economy and US funds being siphoned off to family, friends and donors.

It only feeds Trump's fervor, precisely because even in his dim intelligence he can discern that it is a very, very badly formed question. That's exactly the kind of question that won't work. It is, one could even say, the very reason we have Trump in power in the first place. If Trump enrages me, this reporter's question makes me throw up in my mouth.

Whether x number of people die has nothing to do with any comparison to a high mortality event (such as a war); it has to do with the intrinsic nature of the death dealing event in conjunction with the competence of response. To put it in the general terms she uses about ""a POTUS"", meaning that any president will be a failure if they lose a lot of people, no matter the event, especially if the death count is more than a great and infamous war, regardless of why those people died, is a guaranteed way to take that little shot she has and throw it away. If the San Andreas fault went and killed a million people, would we say, ""well any president in charge when the US lost a *million people* in one day is a failure if it is more than the number of Americans killed in WWII, clearly"". This has to do with the nature of the mortal event. In a way, it's the same as saying ""I'm shocked -- SHOCKED -- that X"". Which doesn't say shit.

Now, if she were to have focused very specifically on the incompetence of February, the inability to do the math in a timely manner, to initiate strong containment measures, etc., she might have had a chance at putting a dent in his armor.

He has to have active cooperation from many state governments.

Why aren't we at war with Iran? Why haven't all states reopened?

The teleprompter crisis,

The Dijon mustard crisis,

The Obama spends too much time golfing crisis

The sneeze guard crisis,

The sleeveless Michelle Obama crisis,

The tan suit crisis,

The tire gauge crisis.

The Arugula Moment,

The lobster dinner crisis,

The ""Ape in heels"" moment, for Michelle

The ""Ape in college"" moment for Malia.

And the time an 11 year old Malia wore a shirt with peace sign on it and got called a wh*re.

The terrorist fist bump crisis. 

The, too many executive orders crisis, you know, like Trump does

The saluting with a coffee cup crisis,

The putting his feet on the desk crisis.

The cost of vacationing in Hawaii crisis.

The Jade Helm military invasion of Texas.

The Obama wants to talk with our enemies without preconditions, like Trump does, crisis.

The bike helmet crisis, 

The ""Hip Hop BBQ birthday celebration that didn't create any jobs"". crisis.

And then there they were the insults to his family and his presidency.

The Michelle is transgender and actually named Michael, and Obama is secretly gay, crisis.

Joe Wilson yelling ""You lie"", at a State of the Union Address.

The theft of a supreme court nomination, and 140 Lower Court Justices from Obama and America.

The multiple do nothing congresses that refused to give Obama anything to sign for fear he would have some kind of legacy when he left office.

And finally, just to show how angry the Republicans were with the Obama presidency, the Republicans elected Donald Trump to be president.

##---------------------------------------------------------------------------##

**So, why didn't they use any of these rape accusations you're bringing up now to attack Obama's vice president and the Obama presidency?**

Because Republicans lie, and Trump Republicans + Russians, they've got everybody else beat when it comes to lying. 

Trump/Republican philosophy;

If at first you don't succeed,

3666,trump,"But if Biden ""just grabbed her by the pu$$y"" that's ok, right? We accept that now, right? We heard the now-President of the United States Donald Trump state, while he was working - while he was on the job - that he would ""just grab 'em by the pussy,"" after which time we elected him. This is what we do now. This is who we are.",1,1588426357

Time to grow up before you help trump win again like you guys did in 2016.",1,1588429755
3669,trump,"It shows you are a pathetic privileged fraud who has nothing at stake due to your privilege and will therefore sit out the election because you didn’t get what you want.


It means you are a garbage person. Worse than a trumpie.


You would be fine with trump hurting a lot more people. Because of your ego.


You are pathetic and a POS.


Byeee.",1,1588430540
3670,trump,"""You guys""?

You have the intellectual honesty of a fourth grader who has lied to the principal.  

No, I don't *think* he did it.  He didn't.  This is a troubled woman with no proof, complaint, or consistency to her story.  Plus, there were formal steps Congress took in that era with the Bob Packwood scandal that would have required the Senate HR to initiate an inquiry to protect a complainant.  She filed no complaint with them or the Capitol police.

Your simply running with the wishful hopes of Donald Trump, Jr. and FOX News that this lie will stick and somehow buoy his father's chances of another inside straight with the Electoral College.

Again, you'd make a horrible prosecutor.  You look at the world through a purely political and non-subjective lens.",1,1588432299

3672,trump,"By delegate count, she’s not even 10% as liked as Sanders.

She has 81 delegates and the Sanders has 974.

So where are you getting that she’s more like-able? By the metrics we have in place she is clearly not.

Also, why are you trying to pick some weird fight? You brought up Bernie out of nowhere and now you’re trying to bring up something else which has nothing to do with what we’re talking about. 

Which is that Warren is a terrible VP pick. She couldn’t carry her own state which means, she does nothing but hurt Biden’s chances of beating Trump. 

If you actually care about beating Trump you hope she goes back to being an awesome member of Congress and stays off the ticket.",1,1588435927
3673,trump,"Are you going to vote against Trump anyway? Or are you going to assume defeat and roll over?

I don't like Joe either - he wasn't my first, second, or third choice. I think he's lost his edge and comes off like a doddering gaff machine. But I'm voting for him. You best believe I don't want another 4 years of Trump - I don't think our democracy will survive it.",1,1588436916

And obviously she does offer something, if 42% say she is best choice.

I am mocking Sanders because his supporters are salty as fuck and help trump.

If it were Sanders versus Warren in MA, she would have beaten Sanders. As Clinton did.

It’s going to be Harris or Warren. 

So quit your bullshit, bro.",1,1588437647

3677,trump,"“Again, she lost to the winner.”
Yes, and she lost the second place person as well. 

“If it were Sanders versus Warren in MA, she would have beaten Sanders.”
So in a made up world she would have won. Good point. 

“I am mocking Sanders because his supporters are salty as fuck and help trump”
So Sanders has nothing to do with the conversation and you’re just being toxic and hateful for no reason. 

“It’s going to be Harris or Warren.”
Neither of whom came in first in their own state. 

“So quit your bullshit, bro.”
I’m not the one attacking strawmen and pretending 3rd place is 2nd. 

We’re done now.",1,1588438552

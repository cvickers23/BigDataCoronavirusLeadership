0,fauci,"I don't believe he is because of the blatant outright lies that come directly from his mouth or his twitter.  In his address, maybe last Wednesday, he stated that, ""millions of Americans will be able to be tested.""  The very next day Dr. Fauci confirmed that no, we do not have the capability to test at that level at all.

So that's just one example.  Republican/Democrat, I always felt like Bush or Obama were telling you the truth.  Sure it is from their perspective, but in that respect it was the truth.

With Trump, he has often told outright lies and it is just too much and extremely disappointing in a time of such uncertainty.

The choices I need to make in my brain are that A: He is outright lying to me, or B:  He is completely incompetent.  In either case I am done with the man and the damage he has done to the GOP will be long lasting.

Please practice as much social distancing as possible.  The 80% or so of us who end up with mild colds or relatively asymptomatic are endangering the other 20% who need this spread out so that hospitals are able to do their best to keep up with those who will need treatment.

I don't believe that a federal government response is doomed to failure.  In this case though, it seems like the person is charge is almost dooming it to failure through inaction, lies and incompetence.  Be thankful if your state governor is taking up the slack and is making the hard calls that will be necessary to slow the spread of this virus.

At some point the virus will peak and have infected enough people that it's slow down is inevitable.  That day is likely very far away still.  I am happy that hopefully next summer the scientists of the world will have come together and managed to develop a vaccine, so that remaining pockets and new populations of children born are able to receive something to provide the race with herd immunity (90% of us).

Please stay safe, happy and healthy.",1,1584546541
1,fauci,"First of all, there are many different strains of the virus, and likely different virulence.

[https://nextstrain.org/ncov](https://nextstrain.org/ncov)

In that regard, this article explains a lot:

[https://www.redstate.com/stu-in-sd/2020/03/16/wuhan-virus-and-bioweapons-the-past-is-prologue/](https://www.redstate.com/stu-in-sd/2020/03/16/wuhan-virus-and-bioweapons-the-past-is-prologue/)

So it would seem that Italy (and Europe) likely has something more akin to the original Wuhan strain. That would explain the severity.  

Outside Hubei, the virus does seem milder.  And only 1% will develop symptoms (not die).

[https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2762808/incubation-period-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-from-publicly-reported](https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2762808/incubation-period-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-from-publicly-reported)

Of the ones that develop symptoms, most will have mild disease.  In the USA, only a minority of active cases are severe:

[https://virusncov.com/covid-statistics/usa](https://virusncov.com/covid-statistics/usa)

All the scary Vox and WashPost videos scare you with the number of new cases, but the question I asked is ""if you become exposed and turn positive serologically, what are the chances of getting very sick?"" The answer is very reassuring.  Data from South Korea and the Diamond Princess are very reassuring for most people under 65.  Even for those older, the majority do recover.  

[https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/16/lower-coronavirus-death-rate-estimates/](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/16/lower-coronavirus-death-rate-estimates/)

Remember, all the calls for sequester-in-place and locking the cities down come from the same people who would dismantle our economy for climate change. The world's gonna end in 12 years, right?  That's a clue already.  

What we need is a smarter strategy.  Rather than shut down the nation, we need to concentrate isolation efforts to only certain cities, like Los Angeles, San Francisco, NYC and any other areas of high population density and high infection /death rates, where the borders have been open, and filth abounds.  Cities like Portland are doing fine, but they still get unimpeded traffic from Seattle and California, yet they want people to stay in their homes.  We also need to focus any protective sequestration efforts on where the elderly live, like nursing homes and LT care facilities, just as if they had norovirus.  

We should not turn our cities into ghost towns.  We know much more since the early Wuhan days.  Look at Japan and S Korea, who didn't have to do anything radical, with their dense population densities.  We should learn how they did it. 

People, we are rapidly losing our civil liberties.  Right before our eyes, we are slowly turning into countries like Venezuela, Chile and Romania did.  Don't worry about the rising case rate.  As more people get tested, you'll see more cases.  Focus on the death rate, and how very low it is.  Focus on the low recovery rate, and remember - if you never get sick you won't be counted as recovered.  The low recovery with low death numbers indicate that the majority of exposed don't even get sick.  (It would be different if the recovery rate was low and the death rate was high, but that's not the case.) - Again, see the [virusncov.com](https://virusncov.com) site above. 

Trump's doing his best to steer the nation away from apocalyptic behavior, but the problem is that his scientific representative (Fauci) prefers the scare approach, and the media are there to pump it up.  He's a brilliant virologist, but perhaps not Trump's best pick to guide public policy.   

And now, we have the earliest spring equinox in 124 years to warm up the climate.  The virus may fade in the warmth, but many of the closed businesses may not come back, and confidence in the economy has been greatly broken.",1,1584772367
2,fauci,"Immune people ""going back to work"" simply doesn't recover the economy, sir. The death rate is still unknown but Fauci has mentioned it as being possibly 1% because of the exact discrepancies in infected data you just mentioned. Nobody needs you to put in a random number guess like 600k for US so 0.4 % death rate. And do refrain from ""a centre opened near me"" so the testing is fantastic narrative too.",1,1585552802
3,fauci,"Fauci can say what he wants, but we've literally seen and heard Trump on a number of occasions downplay the virus. Trump also golfed 7 or 8 times *and* did 7 rallies or so after finding out about COVID-19, so you cant tell me he took it seriously. Wish he'd just be honest that he made a mistake .

5,fauci,"It's hard to parse out the exaggeration and negativity anymore but I just want to point out a few things that are implied here that nobody has mentioned yet.
1. He is undermining the security of the Postal Service which is a federal agency under the Executive branch. Undermining the Intelligence Departments, Military, and USPS is unacceptable for a president but especially befuddled when this one is under his direct purveyors. If he thought it was ran fraudulently, why not fix it earlier?
2. He seems to be proposing we all go out and crown public buildings for hours on end to vote. This again is against the recommendations of the WHO, CDC, AND Dr. Fauci.
3.  Isn't it just really embarrassing to read anything he says when it is typed out verbatim? Like, future school children are gonna a reason this and be like, ""why don't I understand what that President was saying? Is this some bizarr-o version of Shakespeare?""",1,1586026999
6,fauci,"His approach is unbelievably shortsighted. Do you think that asking 3M to stop selling n95 face masks to Canada was a good idea when the woodpulp required to make them can only be produced in Quebec and Trudeau has already vowed to respond? Do you think proposing medications and vaccines for other drugs would stop coronavirus was a good idea? Do you think any of his quotes about having ""0 cases by tomorrow"" will age well? Do you think undermining, contradicting, and disregarding the recommendations for Dr. Fauci paid off? Do you think that his news station, Fox News, will evade the mounting lawsuits that will result from calling coronavirus a hoax (and if you think that had nothing to do with him we'll have another problem here)? It'd be damn hard to attribute a percentage of the blame to him but sure as hell it isn't a negligible amount.",1,1586027892

10,fauci,"What is the claim here? Is this suggesting that this was a an engineered disease and that Dr. Fauci was in on the conspiracy? If you were in on a conspiracy like that, why tell everyone?",1,1586201785
11,fauci,"I would say there’s just as many “studies” and personal stories saying the opposite. That’s why it’s a bad idea to jump to conclusions right now. 

For example, Newsweek reported doctors in Sweden are no longer prescribing the drug to treat COVID-19 patients due to its negative side effects. 

“One of the patients affected was Carl Sydenhag, a 40-year-old Stockholm resident. According to Expressen, Sydenhag was prescribed two tablets of chloroquine to take daily after he was diagnosed with COVID-19 on March 23.

But instead of making him feel better, the medication produced unpleasant side effects. As well as cramps and vision loss, Sydenhag experienced a headache that felt like stepping into ""a high voltage plant,"" he told the paper.”

Personally, from the data I’ve seen I wouldn’t be surprised if hydroxychloroquine does indeed treat some cases of COVID-19 when used in combination with zinc. However, the problem with jumping to this conclusion (especially by the President) is that doctors are prescribing this drug without fully knowing how it will effect different people. There are drugs that can cure a severely sick person but then could also kill another person. 

For example, a well known side effect of hydroxychloroquine is fatal heart arrhythmia and cardiac arrest. The FDA needs to set clear guidelines as to who should not take the drug, or when the risks are worthwhile, would risks be mitigated if taking the drug at the onset when symptoms are mild or only when it gets severe, would taking a combination of drugs offset these risks or exacerbate, etc.

It’s good to be optimistic, but when it comes to medication I think it’s best to proceed with caution (and a lot of skepticism of people without any credible expertise in this field making claims). I would at least wait until Dr. Fauci supports it since he will most likely be one of the first to obtain and understand the data.",1,1586251284
12,fauci,"Interesting, thank you for the thoughtful response. I knew pharmacists are often more up to date on drugs, but wasn’t aware of your role as part of the physician’s team treating the patient. All the pharmacists I know are institutional or community, and the only ones I know working on clinical trials have a Ph.D in pharmacology or are Ph.D/MD. It sounds like you’re more on the individual patient care side than clinical trials though, if I read it correctly. 

Personally, I agree there’s promising data for its use but I’m with Dr. Fauci that further study needs to be done to prove its efficacy in treatment of COVID-19 before physicians are prescribing it en masse, particularly in regards to dosage and clearer guidelines for who should not take the drug due to negative side effects. I realize there’s nothing better and by all means, take it if the doctor tells you to no one’s going to judge, but I’m concerned there will be an over prescription of this drug and people will get seriously hurt due to misinformation. (Not including that poor guy who took pool cleaner, there will always be crazy outliers.)

The current studies I’ve seen are all over the place. Have you found any compelling ones either for or against? I would love to be better informed. Thanks again for taking the time to respond, you must be super busy these days and I hope you’re able to stay safe.",1,1586268873

Also, Trump waited until it was almost too late to put these measures into place. There’s a reason we have the most infected in the world, with the second most infected country having almost 400,000 cases less than us.",1,1586628320
18,fauci,"That was an incredibly dimwitted and racist response. 

You realize that reopening stuff doesn’t happen overnight? It takes more than a days preparation. Trump was preparing to lift quarantines for April 12th back in late March, and Fauci had to basically yell at him to not reopen, as that would cause a lot of new infections and make things worse.

Great work at comparing Chinatown to China, that’s incredibly simple minded and racist. You only have a problem with that because it was Pelosi. I guarantee you in any republican did that, you’d be singing praise for them.

I’ll grant you the China infection thing, especially since US intelligence (and Wuhan whistleblowers) confirmed that the real stat is much higher (plus it was kind of obvious).

America has more infected people than Italy, Spain, France, and the UK combined (and before you say anything, the combined population between those countries is roughly equal to America’s population). Of those 4 countries, Italy and Spain and starting to plateau in their infection rate, while UK and France are still way behind us in deaths per day and not raising as exponentially as we did. We’re doing worse than the bulk of Europe, where the virus went to after China.

I don’t know how else to phrase this in a way that will get through to you, but the problem is Trump. He isn’t being strict enough on this, he is too busy golfing (he’s golfed 6 times since the outbreak started in Wuhan), holding rallies (9 times since it started), and trying to privatize the postal service so he can stop mail in voting (which would flatten the curve of infection, as people would not be crammed into a poling station). He also is not allowing his hotels to be used as makeshift hospitals, nor is he allowing frontline workers to use them. He is not worried about the American people, he is worried about getting reelected so he can keep his power, and so he can keep influencing policies to enrich himself and his family.

35,fauci,"Right, and I believe that Trump imposed the European travel ban before the states did.  There is some talk that this virus (actually I read a news article) existed in California in December, before we even knew of it.  There's an article o it too.  And while we admittedly don't know what the immediate or short-term is (regardless of what people say I have read no expert, even the CDC, say that these effects are permanent.  No one has never said we won't in the next few years be able to freely leave our house without face masks or hang out in our neighbors homes again.  That's not my concern, because I'll know we'll do it because the worst case scenario (my bigger concern is that a vaccine won't be effective and that, when told we can travel again people just won't want to do it).  But one thing I need to point out, and an area I disagree  with Trump on is it's up to the States to reopen the government, though they do need to work in collaboration with the federal government and dare I say the medical expects to reopen the business (by the way, the economy never closed...essential businesses were always open, it was partly shut down, but people could still get what they needed....though even essential businesses probably have had staff laid off.

Lastly, I will point out that I don't trust the CDC, there models were wrong, why is that?  And why should I trust Fauci?  I'm sure he's a great, capable doctor....excellent one.  The reason I don't exactly trust the CDC is this, it's a NOVEL virus.  Brand new, we don't know a thing about it.  Meaning, we don't even know if it will occur?  Is it likely or possible?  Maybe, but it's just as possible that July 4th will be here and this will disappaate.  Sadly, it's also possible (and likely) to be here forever.  That's why masks, social distancing and other measures might be a good short term solution but not a long term because a vaccine is not guarantee.  Virus change over time, and no one, not even Fauci and the other doctors know the way this will change or if it does.  Novel means brand new....in my opinion we've all been doing the best we can....even Trump.  If anyone dropped the ball it was China in telling us how serious this was.",1,1587075173

https://www.mysanantonio.com/business/article/Why-does-Trump-call-an-86-year-old-unproven-drug-15182607.php

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the man Trump himself appointed to the position chief of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has gone on to say it hasn't been proven to work in humans. This is Trump's own man. The man he appointed, the man who, one could assume, would be another puppet for Trump and his supporters, yet he has publicly stated this drug is not the answer, at least not right now, if ever. And before you even ask, here is where Dr. Fauci says that.

37,fauci,i don’t know about you but i trust Dr Fauci more than some israeli,1,1587233989
38,fauci,"Of course it wouldn’t, he’s receiving praise from bi partisan governors and even Fauci is saying that Trump is listening to the experts. I don’t think there’s a single person that thinks Trump will lose",1,1587327465
39,fauci,"According to Dr. Fauci, ~~M~~Litigation is the answer.",1,1587502401
40,fauci,So what do you think he would’ve done differently right now? It seems like everybody has an opinion of the way things are but nobody has an idea of how they could be different? Obviously he fell for the bullshit from Fauci over estimating this disease but who knew how bad it could’ve been but most people don’t get sick according to the reports that just came out in California,1,1587613521
41,fauci,"Meh, who cares anyway?

If hydroxy works great, great. If hydroxy isn't the answer, who cares?

It's just a side show because Trump mentioned that it seems to have some efficacy in treatment. However, it's still a matter of some debate and, scientifically, it's still anecdotal.

Both Trump and Fauci are right on this one. But, somehow, because we can try to undermine President Trump's medical license by making hydroxy ineffective, it's good.

Except Trump doesn't have a medical license and even if those early reports are wrong it doesn't actually undermine him one iota. Who cares? At worst it's simply The Audacity of Hope.",1,1587623530
42,fauci,All of that is true but the problem is not everyone is as reasonable as you. Some people will hear that message and immediately assume that this is the end all drug. That's why Fauci was so cautious about it. He knew how susceptible people we are.,1,1587659099
43,fauci,"I ignore when Trump speaks and just wait for Fauci or Birx.

But, it's common to people. Consider how many people go around talking about the ""scandal free Obama Administration.""

That's as tone deaf and stupid as believing Trump is infallible. However, it's the same side of the coin. They both refuse to see truth in favor of a salvific image.",3,1587708960
44,fauci,"Voting record doesn't make a difference when we've already seen her decision-making in action. 

Her and DeSantis were some of the few who ignored the doomsayers and went with their **own** plans. 

That already shows me they've got the courage to stand up for what's right.

I could see your argument with someone like Crenshaw, who doesn't have much of a voting record or even state-wide experience.

But Noem has just maneuvered through two months of insanity and has stood firm against even Fauci trying to bully her into doing what he wanted. 

That's more than enough experience.",1,1588171789

52,cuomo,I live in New York. And as a flaming conservative I can say Cuomo is handling this situation really well. If New York continues to do well and he is still doing a good job I may just throw him a pity vote in November for a job well done. But he only gets one.,16,1584568204
53,cuomo,"I am totally with you and was saying this until this Wuhan bullshit. But from a hardcore conservative in NYS, I appreciate Cuomo. I honestly think this is the only acceptable time for conservative New Yorkers to actually support Cuomo. Fuck Fredo forever but Cuomo has been doing a great job. I’ll stand behind him but FUCK DEBLASIO. 

Edit: And I won’t care how many downvotes I get here. I’ll still stand by him during these times. NY is fucked up right now and politics has no belonging here right now.",6,1584576634

56,cuomo,"It is not his fault at all. This is China's fault entirely. China let this crap happen, the covered it up and they left the world scrambling after they let this thing out in the first place. This is what, the 3rd virus they've let escape from their country?

Things could have been handled better here in a few areas, certainly. But ordering mandatory curfews and mandatory quarantines across the entire country right off the bat? Even Andy Cuomo is saying Trump is doing a good job. I mean Andy Cuomo.

Should we go into lock down for two weeks every time there is a virus? We just crippled the economy and we aren't even on full lock down, millions will lose jobs. Think about the loss of life that can happen when a full blown economic depression hits. Think about the family stress, the suicides, the divorce rates, the elderly people losing care.... and that would happen every time we shut down completely not knowing the severity of the situation. The cure becomes worse than the disease. If we shut down like this for SARS? What do you think would happen?",1,1584743941
57,cuomo,Rumors and teases on political sites: Ghost Biden will be unable to continue campaigning and DNC will choose Governor Andrew Cuomo as their candidate. Just reading it on Reddit.,1,1584934689
58,cuomo,"But shouldn’t trump set the precedent? We have so many different states handling this so differently. As much as I hate to say it, Cuomo I’m NY is actually dealing with the outbreak super well, getting a lot of testing, quarantining the NY population early m, etc. But Trumps lack of action really results in States like I think Kentucky that just recently closed down schools.",1,1585145282
59,cuomo,"Of course he should. Love, hate him, or think he’s just a crazy moonbat, he’s been out there campaigning and doing this the right way. I think the Dems would be remiss to try and stuff HRC or Cuomo in there.",1,1585178456
60,cuomo,A dark horse candidate? That’s what you have when someone is running far behind and charges late to the front. There are only two candidates and Bernie isn’t a dark horse. Cuomo would be a non-candidate. These idiots will implode and it will be hilarious cause Creepy Joe will be sworn in to the Senate! 🤣🤣,1,1585178673
61,cuomo,"Have you ever noticed how worn and weathered presidents look after a single term?  There’s absolutely no way Biden could manage 4 years of presidency.  I’m going to disclaim this as a Republican, but Cuomo really is the best option for the Dems at this point, and he’s looking more appealing than Biden everyday especially with all the camera time he’s getting surrounding COVID.  


That being said, I think it’s worth noting that it’s sad to see another human begin to lose their mental faculties, and even more sad that those around him keep pushing him on TV to devolve into some fool for the world to watch.",1,1585271879

65,cuomo,"To be clear, whoever the Dem is I wholeheartedly hope they lose; just think the DNC and media (but I repeat myself) are coming around to realizing how weak Biden really is. Cuomo suddenly looks like the anointed one in the fawning media coverage and attention he is receiving.",1,1585337725

67,cuomo,His response has been very appropriate without inciting panic. You can always tell when someone is doing a good job when a member of the opposition party credits your response (i.e. Cuomo).,1,1585373135
68,cuomo,"So he's just out for publicity at this point, and political grandstanding. Not the time Cuomo, not the time.",1,1585447645
69,cuomo,"It would be best if he doesn’t totally implode on himself anytime soon. I think it’s unrealistic (yet possible) that if Biden totally sh*ts the bed before the convention they’ll try to recruit Cuomo. He’s got his own problems and isn’t as awesome as the media would have you believe, but at least he can speak. I want Weekend At Biden’s because I want a slam dunk.",1,1585458472
70,cuomo,There is a reason Cuomo didn’t run in 2020.,1,1585581469
71,cuomo,"Oh absolutely, in fact he might be worse than Joe. The thing with Biden is I’m worried he’ll be just a free signature for every Democrat wishlist item. Could be utterly disastrous. Cuomo would fuck us up on his own accord.",1,1585590124
72,cuomo,"There are a lot of institutional power players who have a lot of money invested into Biden who are going to call in favors owed to them when that empty vessel gets in (that’s their hope and they won’t just toss that aside). Cuomo is harder to control and doesn’t owe the same people in the same way. Don’t forget, Biden could also still have HRC as his running mate and as insane as it sounds I wouldn’t be shocked. And Cuomo would never select her. So it won’t be easy switching horses now, though Biden could physically deteriorate to the point he’s just a suit with a dry husk in it and horse flies buzzing around, in which case they’ll have no choice but to replace.",1,1585593705
73,cuomo,Personally I prefer that Trump gets an easy win and can focus more of his time on running the country. Cuomo should just stick to governor,1,1585594848
74,cuomo,"I don't think he does. Even if they hate Biden, Sanders' supporters can admit that he won the primary. They will feel very differently about a Cuomo run.

It's virtually impossible to win an election of 10% of your voting base just stays home.",1,1585605756
75,cuomo,I don't think Cuomo is competent. He talks like a tough guy (with the personal beliefs of a pussy) and that is about all he has going for him. He hasn't handled his state well during the crisis and he never ran it well before today. Just what has this guy done to deserve more TV time than other governors???,1,1585610739
76,cuomo,"I disagree with your misleading title emphasizing that he is stealing them. It specifically states he plans to return and or reimburse the hospitals that have ventilators which are not being used. I don't like Cuomo or any Dems, but this is a good move. NYC deaths and cases are exponential and unlike any other state. 

Scarce equipment not in use SHOULD be relocated to save lives.",1,1585960954
77,cuomo,"Both Andrew and his brother Chris are both fucked up in the head,  Andrew Cuomo wants to take the ventilators from where I live and bring them to NYC while our people DIE because there isn’t no ventilators for us to use for our areas.",1,1586032207
78,cuomo,That guy and governor Cuomo have epically failed the people of New York. When this virus started I thought California would be the worst state but Gavin Newsom has been working WITH Trump instead of whining. NewYorkers should get rid of both mayor and governor. They’re just killing their constituents with poor responses and unpreparedness.,1,1586121712
79,cuomo,"He will apologize right after Nancy, Cuomo, and De blasio for spreading it more. AKA never",1,1586146465
80,cuomo,Yep totally. The establishment democrats have been worse!  Cuomo cut hospital funding and ventilators prior to this!,1,1586146990
81,cuomo,"I think a lot of NYers and people in the tri-state area are currently so focused on their loved ones that will absolutely, and without question, pass away if they contract this virus. Many of us have family members that will pass regardless if the hospital has all the staffing, equipment, preparation, and PPE they need. My uncle has advanced cancer from his time spent at the 9/11 site, and his chemo sessions have been cancelled which can kill him. However if he leaves the house and contacts the virus, he will pass. This doesn’t change 1 week from now or 1 year from now since the virus is here in the community.

So we are so focused on the today and tomorrow, and how do the numbers look. We will care more about the questions of the past when we get through this, but for now we just want leadership to guide us through this time. It is exhausting to see the top leadership of this country place blame on all other parties and even tout fake news - people are dying here!!! Because we need leadership right now more than investigations into what could have been done better, it is very reassuring to hear Gov Cuomo accept blame and responsibility for impact to NY economy, etc etc. After this is over, we will care about what could have been done better but for now we are living just waiting to get word that our family member has started to feel ill. We all feel it coming.

Trump should not be focused on his ratings and the next election cycle and what the news is saying about him. He’s the president right now, today, and people are dying yet he is shunning responsibility, quarreling with people on Twitter, and his organization is saying that stockpiled equipment isn’t for states but is for the federal government. We are sick of this reality show - we want a government!",1,1586355915

90,cuomo,"Trump pushing for more border security helped flatten the curve and without impeding the constitutional rights of the citizens... this helped flatten the curve even before this pandemic started. Border security is not just about illegal aliens, it's about security from disease, security from terrorists, security from drug cartels, security from espionage and so on.

Trump getting tough on China has been helping flatten the curve by getting companies to pull out of their country. This reduces business travel between the US and China (as well as, you know, not helping to fund a horrible communist, fascist, regime). Trump stopping travel from China IN JANUARY (when the WHO was still saying this is nothing to worry about and when China was still lying about their death toll) helped flatten the curve despite the bad information from the WHO and China.

Trump supporting the states in their endeavors helped flatten the curve (and he has been praised by Governors Newsome and Cuomo both for his efforts).

Trump pushing against that idiocy of people like Pelosi claiming this is all racist has helped flatten the curve. While she wasn't taking the threat seriously and saying ""Hey guys, just go hang out in China Town! Don't worry about a horrible virus, gather in large groups and in one of the most close quartered part of the city!"" Trump was closing borders and preparing.

Please explain to us how when one person is saying to take this seriously while another person is saying ""Guys, just keep partying it up!!!"" is the first person's fault.

China let's virus escape.

Trump shuts down travel, prepares for things.

The left calls him racist and goes to party in China Town.

97,cuomo,"Cuomo spent weeks criticizing the President on national tv because of this situation. Saying things like “you choose which people need to die”. 

The left made Cuomo a hero for things like this. In times of crisis, you need leaders who don’t panic and waste resources. Cuomo was in a state of panic and Trump acted like a leader by denying that request. 

New York has 46% of the deaths in the US because Cuomo has made consistent wrong moves with the left praising the entire way. The left has blamed Trump for every single wrong during this crisis and it’s hard to not make the good news political.

So Cuomo took actions to prepare for the worst case scenario.

It's other people, including you, overplaying it.  Then when I point out why this is the case, you accuse of me of dividing people because, somehow, ""numbers"" are divisive.

Second, you said that the virus is out of control.  I'm not even sure how you came to that conclusion.  There have been 60 cases in the entire United States, a country of over 300 million people.  Literally 0.0000000002% of the population.  And you're calling it ""out of control.""  That's beyond hyperbole.  That's just lying.

Never mind that **you asked for them.**  Once someone, me, answered your question with facts you ignored them completely and tried to transition the conversation into an attack on Trump.

#  What's True

The Trump administration's proposed 2021 budget includes cuts to the CDC's activities related to chronic disease. (ED: This is not set in stone, however, and will likely change on updated information)

 It is also true that in 2018 the Trump administration fired key officials connected to the U.S. pandemic response, and they were not replaced.  (ED: YMMV on to what extent this impacts a response; I would hazard that it would, but I cannot say to what extent)

# What's False

Congress hasn't approved the budget, so CDC funding in 2021 remains unclear. (ED: So, no the Administration has not cut funding, nor has Congress)

&gt; World Health Organization (WHO) spokesperson Tarik Jašarević recently [estimated](https://www.vox.com/2020/2/18/21142009/coronavirus-covid19-china-wuhan-deaths-pandemic) the COVID-19’s R naught (the number of other people one sick person is likely to infect on average) is around 2–2.5, whereas at least one study has suggested it could be as high as [3.11](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549v2). Based on the number of confirmed deaths and cases, it has a case fatality rate (CFR) of around 2.65%. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) is thought to have [originated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14738798) in a Chinese ‘wet market’. Although more deadly than COVID-19 – it has a [CFR of 14–15%](https://www.who.int/csr/sars/archive/2003_05_07a/en/) – most cases of human-to-human transmission [occurred in healthcare settings](https://www.who.int/ith/diseases/sars/en/) and it only made its way to 26 different countries before being contained.  
   
Its [estimated R naught](https://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/WHOconsensus.pdf) during the initial phase of the epidemic was 2.9, but the implementation of control measures reduced it to 0.4 in the final months of the outbreak. 

From  [https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-myths.html](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-myths.html) 

&gt; The annual flu typically has a mortality rate of around 0.1% in the U.S. So far, there's a 0.05% mortality rate among those who caught the flu virus in the U.S. this year, according to the CDC. 

So as a summation, COVID's considerably not as dangerous as SARS (about 1/4th as dangerous, fatality-wise), and less infectious (by about 10% less), but substantially more dangerous than the common flu (at least in the US and presumably in most other 1st world countries).",1,1582998711

But this started when dems began accepting lobby money during the Clinton era. They kept losing elections because money bought republicans over and over again. 3 decades later, Democrats are trying to undue that one decision.

What would make this interresting is if sanders realized that basically the other candidates were bought off with posts to stay in the game as long as possible, he would go, ""you know what, if they can stay democrat for as long as possible only to be bought out by the designated nominee, surprise, this is now an independant run, what you gonna do about it?

The DNC is trying to protect Biden as much as possible, because they too expect a disaster from him at any moment. Jill might have suggested they be seated this time. This is cruel. There is no valid explanation for this that anyone could give for allowing this. Like him or not, I think his biggest moment is going to be embarrassing for the country, a cringe worthy moment where he says something highly inappropriate in the middle of a televised speech or an answer during a debate and someone (Jill) will have to come out to the stage and walk him off and the camera will suddenly cut to commercial. They'll say later that it was ""really hot in the room"" and he felt flushed. So then what, do they proceed with Joe?

For goodness sake, can't compare a pandemic (Trump's challenge) with a few cases of Ebola in the USA. Moreover, we went to Africa, all suited up, put those 11 patients in negative pressure isolation capsules and carried them back to the USA in air ambulances that then delivered them to specialized units to be treated. The only place that had no such protections (treating 1 African man in Texas) led to the infection of 2 Americans. The infectiousness of Ebola is way lower than that of COVID19. We knew what those 11 people had, and Ebola is a very lethal and very well known virus. And yes, the USA outstandingly helped in West Africa to end the Ebola epidemic, but we had plenty of help from many countries and Docs without Borders in handling the gigantic number of cases.

In the case of COVID19 we're facing thousands, hundreds of thousands (probably) potential cases of infection with a totally unknown virus, and a completely unknown disease for which nobody on earth is immune and the treatment of which we (humanity) have had no experience treating or even seeing before. The long incubation period has taken everybody everywhere in the world by surprise, with countries facing sudden explosions in the number of infected people. Nobody can help anybody, because everybody is taking care of their own, and justly so.

We don't have such advantages or low with COVID-19.

This guy should be replaced with someone with more objective, less apocalyptic and less partisan mind. Partisanship and uneven comparisons (like those that compared COVID19 with the flu) help no one. They're only wasting time and obstructing the efforts and positive spirit needed to fight this darn virus.

In Obama’s case (when he handled it terribly) the media said nothing. However even though trump has been acting on the virus quickly the media is criticizing just about everything he does.

Basically the video is about how US society is becoming more comfortable with censorship the closer we get to the 2020 presidential election. How this is first happening on social media, but it is spreading offline as well.

Conservatives, republicans &amp; trump supporters should be especially aware of the censorship as you are the number one targets affected by it.

409,trump,"Maybe President Trump should have done a better job preparing our testing infrastructure in the 2 months he had to get ready for this threat? 

This is how democracy works, when you do a shitty job, which Trump has personally (Coronavirus is a hoax, I take no personal responsibility for the testing rules and regulations) you get hit for it. It’s a carrot and stick system, you get rewarded for good actions and held accountable for bad. 

Also, where was this spirit of bipartisanship when Obama was implementing his recovery plan? We’re Republicans being ‘bad Americans’ for criticizing him?

The Democrats are doing their job, pointing out the failures of the Trump administration. The real problem is that it took up until late this week for Trump to do his and publicly acknowledge this threat for the acute threat it poses.",1,1584298678
410,trump,"COVID-19 is very well under control within the US, when you look at how fast and how many people are affected in other countries. 

As soon as Trump caught wind of a possible virus in China he CLOSED travel to and from China, against professional advice. Which turned out to be a determining factor in what could have happened if they stayed open until it got to bad. 

You know who called him a racist for doing so? The democrats. Donald Trump is putting in the efforts behind the scenes to try to help as much as possible, while in the meantime not trying to cause a mass panic. 

If you can’t see that you are ignorant to the facts. People like you will find absolutely anything to target and harass the president for no matter what he does. Please use your brain when making comments online for thousands of people to read, so you don’t look stupid to most, and spread misinformation to those whose minds are very malleable such as our youth.

411,trump,"Ignorant to the facts? It was two day ago that he announced everything to be under control and that the virus would soon fade away. Fade away. He said it would soon fade away because he like to speak ‘off the cuff’. He screws up. It’s too little too late. The numbers in America can’t be compared to other nations simply because of size but I don’t expect you to understand that. The numbers of infected are up from yesterday, the day before and so on.

OK. So this is a thing he likes to do with pardons which appeals largely to the African-American community. Largely, this is good behavior on Trump's part.

Liberal media doesn't cover it because non-violent criminal offenders being let off the hook by gasp... Trump doesn't play to their rhetoric or overarching message. Conservative media doesn't cover it because criminals of any kind should be hammered out of existence",1,1584330956
429,trump,"Also the point I’m trying to make is that people are blowing the COVID-19 virus way out of proportion. Yes, we still need to take precautions, but we do not need to spread mass panic throughout the country or else the virus will not be the only problem we have. The main reason most of the pandemics that have occurred in history had become a major problem is because people blew it out of proportion when if everyone had remained calm the problem could’ve been solved in a better way. Take people going mass shopping as an example the amount of them that probably had the COVID-19 virus and just spread it like crazy only because the president decided to declare it a national emergency is not okay. So if people hadn’t been pushing president Trump to declare it an emergency the virus probably wouldn’t have spread as much as it did. For the second part these kind of things are going to happen and guess what, the world is just going to have to move on. We can’t put life on hold just because of the virus. Please note that I am being extra careful when it comes to possible chances of getting the virus because if I get it, it will most likely kill or severely damage my lungs because I have had respiratory issues my entire life.",1,1584333975
430,trump,"I think it’s a lot safer for everyone if we all overreact rather than underreact. If this fizzles out in a couple months without too much damage, then fine..  the economy will recover and Trump will look like a hero. But if this thing rages through the county for many months (which right seems more likely to happen) and we’re caught with our pants down... then we could be facing a disaster of historic proportions. No one is advocating for panic, and I don’t think people stocking up a bit is really a sign of panic. But now is not the time to hesitate on responding to this as forcefully as possible.

If you’re going to say that’s a ton more, technically Romney had a larger % turnout than Trump. Trump got 46.1% of the votes in 2016. Romney received 47.2% of the votes in 2012.

Romney is okay for a Republican. Just out of curiosity, can people not agree with the President without symbolizing everything you hate?",1,1584513939
499,trump,"Oh get over yourself.  Turnout isn't about total numbers.  It's about **where** you turnout.  People turned out for Hillary Clinton.  They just didn't turn out where it mattered, and that cost her the elections.  

&gt;Just out of curiosity, can people not agree with the President without symbolizing everything you hate?

Sure, but in the case of Romney, he **does** symbolize everything we hate.  Always has.  As a governor he helped pioneer this abomination we call Obamacare.  Even now he's supporting a massive universal income idea.  While it's more sensible than other UBI proposals in the past, it's still not an approach that is historically supported by the Republican Party.  He supported a massive civil liberties violation with his lifetime GPS tracking idea, and that doesn't win him any points with the Libertarian wing of the Republican Party.  He is closer to Bernie Sanders on education policy than the Republican Party as he proposed free college for the top 25% of high school graduates.  He's not a 2nd Amendment supporter and actually flat out said that the NRA wouldn't support his positions, which is unsurprising since he wanted waiting periods and more assault weapons ban bills.  

Look, I'm not going to go as far as to call Romney a liberal.  But he's not in line with the Republican Party's positions of the past 20 years.  On a good day, he's at best a 70% Republican.  Some of the issues that he breaks with the party on are big ticket items, like gun control and an opt in Medicare system for many people.  He also offended and alienated a lot of Republicans when he tried to declare himself as being ""severely conservative"" when his record clearly shows that isn't true.  He offended the religious right when he tried to tell then that they were comparable to Mormons.  

So, bottom line, Romney is not in line with the mainstream Republican Party, and he only got as many votes as he did because Republicans had no one else to vote for.  Had there been a spoiler candidate running third party, he'd have been slaughtered.  Trump's positions are not in line with people like Romney, but he **is** more in line with the Republican voters on the issues.  There's still a lot of desperate conservative martyrs who feel the need to break from Trump on moral grounds, but even most of those people are closer to Trump than Romney when you actually measure them out issue by issue.  

So, yeah, you can disagree with Trump without symbolizing everything we hate.  Ben Shapiro and Michael Knowles do it all the time.  But Romney ain't that guy.  He's a gun grabbing, Medicare-for-most, anti-civil liberties guy.  And while he may have a good record on taxes, trade, and abortion, the fact that some of his divergent views are such big ticket items sinks him in the eyes of the voters.",1,1584521144
500,trump,"The real story was Joe Manchin voting against Trump. Although Manchin is a Democrat, it almost seems like political suicide to vote against trump in wv",1,1584523708
501,trump,I think this right here is the problem. Does being a republican mean being FAR right now?  That’s being a conservative not being a republican to me. They are not the same thing. I think Romney would have been a much better president and handled this pandemic much better then trump simply because he’s a moderate. Being a super conservative brings its own set of problems just like being far left (Bernie) is much more problematic then moderate Democrat platforms.,1,1584526591
502,trump,"Well, I'll disagree with your characterization of my position.  It's not that Romney isn't Republican enough for me.  It's that he's not Republican enough for Republican voters at large.  I say this based on opinion polls with Republican voters as they've reported by different news agencies over the years.  Romney was simply never in line with Republican voters as much as Trump is.  On a purely objective measure of positions, Trump is more representative of the most common Republican voter than Romney ever was.  

The Republican voters have been swinging heavily towards a type of populism for a long time.  You may not be completely on board with that.  And I'm fine with that because I'm not either.  My own positions aren't as representative of most Republicans as Trump's are.  If anything, I probably fall right in between the two men on the spectrum, maybe even a little more towards Romney.  But, as I said, Romney takes the wrong position on certain issues that are much more heavily weighted by voters than others.  A pro-abortion candidate has very slim chances of making it very far except for a few key areas of the country.  And the same goes for a pro-gun control candidate like Romney.  The 2nd Amendment is a big deal to Republicans and is most often more heavily weighted than something like gay marriage or trade.  Trump's most anti-gun move was to ban bump stocks, something the vast majority of shooters didn't care about to begin with.  

Look at what happened since Romney.  Look at the surge of the Tea Party. The Republican underwent a near total rejection of the established neoconservative regime that had defined the party for decades.  It shouldn't come as a surprise that looking back we can more clearly the divergence of populist Republicans from people like Romney.  It may have been difficult to perceive at the time, but now?  Now it couldn't be more clear.",1,1584536441

505,trump,"I don't believe he is because of the blatant outright lies that come directly from his mouth or his twitter.  In his address, maybe last Wednesday, he stated that, ""millions of Americans will be able to be tested.""  The very next day Dr. Fauci confirmed that no, we do not have the capability to test at that level at all.

So that's just one example.  Republican/Democrat, I always felt like Bush or Obama were telling you the truth.  Sure it is from their perspective, but in that respect it was the truth.

With Trump, he has often told outright lies and it is just too much and extremely disappointing in a time of such uncertainty.

The choices I need to make in my brain are that A: He is outright lying to me, or B:  He is completely incompetent.  In either case I am done with the man and the damage he has done to the GOP will be long lasting.

Please practice as much social distancing as possible.  The 80% or so of us who end up with mild colds or relatively asymptomatic are endangering the other 20% who need this spread out so that hospitals are able to do their best to keep up with those who will need treatment.

I don't believe that a federal government response is doomed to failure.  In this case though, it seems like the person is charge is almost dooming it to failure through inaction, lies and incompetence.  Be thankful if your state governor is taking up the slack and is making the hard calls that will be necessary to slow the spread of this virus.

At some point the virus will peak and have infected enough people that it's slow down is inevitable.  That day is likely very far away still.  I am happy that hopefully next summer the scientists of the world will have come together and managed to develop a vaccine, so that remaining pockets and new populations of children born are able to receive something to provide the race with herd immunity (90% of us).

Did you know how many bombings Obama did in Yemen? You would be surprised to know that 400 bombs were dropped PER DAY on poor middle eastern countries paid with OUR American tax dollars. Why should we fund his warmongering middle eastern adventurism?

I say I'm republican cuz u bring up bush and Obama. Bush created the housing bubble. Not Obama. It blew while Obama was just starting. Or around that time. I don't remember. Thing is it didn't happen over night. Bush allowed it to get outta hand. Obama expanded it by keeping interest rates artificially low. For 8 yrs. Unheard of lows. Corporations took advantage of the cheap money and levered up the debt instead of saving. That's bad. Trump called out Obama's bs. He got in office. And left the fed to allow it to stay low. Market exploded. Economy was doing poor though because this bubble was expected. Here's how he could have handled it. Enter office. Say listen up pussies its gonna get bad. But we raise rates. Encourage saving. Stop consuming. Allow companies to fail. Don't give bailouts. And let smarter people come in and manage more efficiently. The recession we would have had would be nowhere near our upcoming depression. Trump needs to stop printing money. Were dumping 1 trillion dollars into the repo market daily this week. So between 5 to 7 trillion. Need to fact check this but almost certain. This is going to lead to mass hyperinflation. Trump is literally doing communist shit. Don't defend him cuz he's gop. Defend what's right. Don't be mad at Obama's bailouts but ok with these. Stop fiat currency. Stop living in debt. People need to have saved for these hard times and not be expecting these 1000$ checks. Remember where you came from. People who survived the great depression and ww2. Were strong enough to survive this depression. But if we print our way into mmt then wages will stay stagnant. Assets will depreciate. And cost of goods will go up. Well be Venezuela.

Bush was a great president; he gave protected our nation from terrorists and helped us recover from the Clinton era economic slowdown. The housing crisis was because Obama had increased regulations on the financial systems that eventually caused it to become overstressed and crash. If he had left it alone, it would have sorted it out by itself. Obama also funneled our tax dollars to bomb the Middle East. Corporations will always take advantage; that is capitalism. We need them to stay competitive. If you don’t bail out, your economy will crash. You are all tough rn and talking like that but you wouldn’t be so tough when you’re outside starving. The Chinese government manipulates their stock markets to stay competitive. We need to give our American companies a leg up too. We’re not running up debt for nothing, our government is the best in the world. What is the only riskless investment? US Treasuries. We are far from becoming Venezuela.

Trump lives at Mar-a-lago or Florida, he deserves time off just like anyone else who works. He has to travel the way his security says so. He is the most powerful person in the world so precautions have to be taken. He has golf courses which if you are in business you'd know more business is done on the golf course than in an actual office. All this means to me is he is using his businesses to promote deals for the U.S. It's not like he is inviting high officials from China to make investment deals into the Trump organization. His golf course or another one, it doesn't matter. He is dealing for America, as far as we know.

I'm not opposed to the OT for coast guard for his protection. That's what our tax money is used for to begin with. 

Duh, if you cut taxes people who make a lot of money get richer. They don't have to pay an arm and a leg for taxes which means more money in their pocket. Taxation is theft 

$1000 bar tab divided by 150million tax payers is so small per tax payer, the person who wrote this article is trying so hard to paint him into a monster. $3.3 million per trip to home, say it comes out to $1B, you think that's a waste of money compared to giving hundreds of billions of dollars to countries that don't even like us? How come the $150B in tax payer money that was sent to Iran by Obama wasn't made into as big a deal? I'm not saying it's not a lot of money or not wasteful but show me a President that didn't spend a lot of tax payer money on vacations while in office.

I'm not saying I agree with what he is doing, or disagreeing, but people hate Trump so goddamn much, if he farts they think he'll blow up the world. I wish everyone was this harsh on every politician. Then all the real corruption shit will come out. I like Trump because of the amount of hate everyone has for him. Do I agree with everything he does, not really. But he's the closest thing to a politician that follows the Constitution we have and I actually like the constitution. The thing that bothers me is hypocrisy. Trump bad, he do this and this. Meanwhile, behind closed doors, ALL politicians are doing the same thing. In the end, say he using tax payer money to do whatever he is doing down in FL, guess what, as a tax payer I say, I'm fine with it.

Yes, the Chinese travel ban was good. But he should have extended it to South Korea and Italy much earlier once it was clear there were outbreaks there (just like was done with Iran, which was politically easy). But even then, a travel ban just delays the inevitable. If you don't use that delay to prepare, which we did not, there isn't much benefit and the end result is the same.

We should have also used our near 2 month head start to getting testing ready: free, easily available, etc. This would have allowed us to actually quarantine the infected and not shutdown our country.

South Korea was able to do this. They have had a good handle on this thing from day 1. Copious testing allowed them to catch new cases quickly and quarantine just those infected. So the number of new cases peaked quickly, within 1-2 weeks. As a result, they haven't had to shut down their economy, institute travel bans, etc.

There is no reason we couldn't have prepared for this as they did, as we had more of a head start. So no, I do not approve of Trump's response.

The one good thing we have going for us, is that companies voluntarily basically shut down everything weeks ago, relatively well ahead of Italy. Concerts and sporting events were cancelled, all employees that can work from home have been doing so, etc. So this should help us, but those were all actions we voluntarily instituted, without government policy.

If this doesn't get better quickly, I could easily see this costing Trump an election that he had in the bag, which is unfortunate because the Democrats have basically become insane.",1,1584736907

In hindsight it was perfectly acceptable and a good move.

It's very easy to judge this with 20/20 hindsight but we're still learning how China lied repeatedly throughout this mess.

For the record, I am a democrat but I was very supportive of trump restricting people who visited China in January. I think it’s a misconception that democrats didn’t think this was a good idea. But where he screwed up completely was being over confident that simply shutting out foreign nationals who had visited China within 14 days was going to be enough to stop the virus from spreading. Also American citizens who had been in China were still allowed and were not asked to self quarantine or had any evaluation by TSA. This was a glaring hole and I have been nervous for months because of this. Secondly, the way he announced the Europe ban was so sudden and didn’t properly inform citizens that they could still come home meant that it caused literally every American tourist in Europe to panic and cram into the airports all at once potentially exposing them. And thirdly, the lack of testing and prioritizing celebrities while regular people who have symptoms are being denied is an atrocity. The lack of testing is going to cost us many many lives because we truly don’t know what our real numbers are. People are in a false sense of security because they might be young and healthy. It also doesn’t help that Pence said “I have no symptoms so I don’t need to be tested.” That is untrue and it’s completely irresponsible.

During a Feb. 28, 2020, campaign rally in South Carolina, President Donald Trump likened the Democrats' criticism of his administration's response to the new coronavirus outbreak to their efforts to impeach him, saying ""this is their new hoax.""

Despite creating some confusion with his remarks, Trump did not call the coronavirus itself a hoax.


Context matters you stupid, stupid, stupid person.

During a Feb. 28, 2020, campaign rally in South Carolina, President Donald Trump likened the Democrats' criticism of his administration's response to the new coronavirus outbreak to their efforts to impeach him, saying ""this is their new hoax."" During the speech he also seemed to downplay the severity of the outbreak, comparing it to the common flu.

What's False

Despite creating some confusion with his remarks, Trump did not call the coronavirus itself a hoax.


Context matters you stupid, stupid, stupid person.

If you had even watched the clip, which of course you haven’t because you’re a lazy zealot, you’d know that he was specifically referring to Democrats blaming him for the coronavirus impact on the US “is their new hoax”. He never suggested that the coronavirus was fake, or anything remotely close to that.

If a person is found speaking out against the government, standard operating procedure is for police to knock at your door.  Sometimes they give you a warning, which of course you will heed.  Other times they put you in cuffs and you disappear, forever.  And if you were evil enough in the government's eyes, they might just disappear your family as well.  

This isn't news, this isn't information people haven't had.  It's China, it's how they do what they do.  

It's become weird, like Twilight zone weird - the way the left and MSM has taken to defending China.  Because President Trump had called out their bad behavior on the world stage on trade and other respects - the left and MSM have rationalized a narrative where by any condemnation or criticism of China, is de facto racism.  Even though we're not talking about the Chinese *people*, we're talking about the Chinese *government* - it doesn't matter, racist!

I’m disappointed in the slow responses from the federal government. I’m happy they are working on it, it’s just been so slow in my opinion. Way back when we had a few cases, two CDC staff came out with two different messages in one day. The gist of one was “it’s not if, it’s when we have it” and the gist the other right after it was “nothing to worry about”.  This made it confusing whether to be alarmed or not. 

When Trump was saying that there was only a few cases and it was under control, I believed him. This is because I assumed the CDC would be conducting intense investigation and contact tracing anytime there was a new case and this seemed manageable since there were only a few cases in Washington and California.

When Trump closed the boarder to a China, I actually thought it would be effective, but then I learned that it only kept foreigners out but not traveling Americans or their families. I also assumed that we would be testing people coming from any place with ANY cases at all. I just figured that the government was 5 steps ahead and that they would handle it. Turns out testing has been a problem for a while.. no tests equals no positive cases. 

The initial constant comparisons to the flu were also misleading to me. When I heard it was just like the flu, I just continued to overlook it. The reality is that the flu isn’t as contagious and doesn’t have so much variability in symptoms. News articles were saying most cases were “mild” which turns out that varies from  no symptoms at all to “mild” pneumonia. 

Then the CDC and other media outlets were telling Americans that masks don’t work despite the virus spreading through respiratory droplets...... which is misleading.

Now everything in my area is for the most part shutdown. The virus is in every state and without any intervention spreads exponentially. 

I relaxed when they fixated on the “elderly” being “most at risk”. It turns out that just means “most at risk to die”, but not necessarily having unpleasant symptoms, being hospitalized, and lung damage. 

Anytime the government tries to give me “hope” I feel like they mislead and misinform me. Just tell me the straight facts about the virus so I can adjust my behavior as necessary and know what to expect. Some days it feels like the response is better, other days not so much.",1,1585362075

741,trump,"&gt; I trust a Dr more than the president when it comes to health

The Doctor, by nature, HAS to be pessimistic in his approach.  It is the only ethical method in his profession.  He has to consider only the worst case scenarios.

Trump, however, has an obligation to present stability, optimism and hope.  He has to prepare for the worst (and he has the Doctor specifically for that) while hoping for the best.

The Doctor can also only view actions through the lens of the virus and what concerns that.  Trump has to weigh other things.  I support the closings and the social distancing policies, but we are going to approach a time when the cure becomes more dangerous than the disease.

742,trump,"The President should be a clear voice to the people in a time of confusion. The most difficult aspect of the COVID-19 bug is how it spreads. Trump should have been clear that this bug is similar to the SARS virus epidemic during the early 2000’s but much worse simply because a patient is highly contagious when they’re asymptomatic. He repeatedly compared the COVID-19 death rate to the flu while down playing the unusual and extreme way the COVID-19 spreads. It’s important to keep the public calm and informed and it appears Trump was unwilling to report the hard truth. 
Crazy as this sounds, his greatest strength might be that he has conditioned the public to not take anything he says too serious. Anyone looking to be informed went to their local government or reliable news sources. 
As far as domestic policy goes, the president’s powers are limited. The latest stimulus bill was the product of the house and senate negotiations. So (like Trump said) let’s stop making this a bipartisan issue and thank the government- the entire government- if this bill goes through. 
And dismantling the pandemic committee when  models had projected a global pandemic upcoming in 2-3 years is just short-sighted. To be fair, if it was similar to the previous SARS virus than it likely would not have had an extreme impact on the US but viruses mutate in unpredictable ways and that’s why they’re so dangerous.

Fact that this time last week we had less then 10,000 people tested, and now this week we have over 500,000 people tested is astounding. I don’t know about you, but to see those number rises in just 7 days is incredible.

747,trump,"Unfortunately incorrect and/or inaccurate at many levels. Viral infections uncontrolled will develop exponentially.... what we're seeing in NYC is their ""peak"" which all other states/cities will have without proper social distancing. The incubation period of the virus before symptoms appear creates an apparent lag time. States like MA which have enforced lockdowns may not approach this same peak now BECAUSE of the proper precautions which sadly needed to be enacted at the state level by governors. Trump declared a national emergency *far* too late (South Korea had their first infection roughly the same time we did but took control of the situation immediately and are doing much better than us) not to mention while it's great he signed the stimulus package (which came from Congress), Trump hasn't made any executive orders to help the economy which I've heard of. While I agree looking at the ratio of infected/total population, you're forgetting that we are vastly under testing in the US (another huge flaw in our response) compared to Europe and some of east Asia. According to Johns Hopkins, actual infections are probably sitting roughly 10x higher than the ""official"" number due to people with no/mild symptoms and those who just do not receive testing due to lack of resources. Countries like South Korea make sure to test EVERYONE even those showing no symptoms. 

The major concept people keep forgetting is that the situation will never get as bad as we predict IF we take the right precautions EARLY and if we don't the result is things can get very bad very quickly before we can turn things around (such as those who believe ""COVID19 is not spreading uncontrollably fast here""... tell that to the overwhelmed hospitals having to triage patients and share ventilators between multiple patients).",1,1585378801

Trump knows that having 300 million people barred from going out in any meaningful sense simply doesn't count as a long term strategy.  It's a temporary way to get time to find actual methods to stop it from growing too quickly.

I'm not a huge fan of trump and especially his mouth, but I would be lying if I said he wasn't an accomplished president. His foreign policy has been a mixed bag and domestically has been quite good. He definitely doesn't get the recognition he deserves and DEFINITELY doesn't deserve the amount of hate he gets from the left and the msm.

People thought he was going to start a war with North Korea than Iran, but so nothing. He’s been the only world leader to make any stand on the uigher concentration camps. 

On the world stage I say man he’s an Asshole but he’s our ass hole. Obama was a weak leader and just wanted to be everyone’s buddy, be well liked. That’s great and all if you want to be a celebrity, horrible for negotiation.",1,1585448797

But I'm not going to deny there's a lot of narcissism on his part. But hey, if we all get a bigger piece of the pie, it's good by me. 
Most people that hate Trump hate him because of his abrasive personality, with little knowledge of what he's actually done for the economy.

783,trump,"I’m a supporter of our president, but he has had some missteps along the way. An example of this is his h-1b program for importing workers to take 85k white collar jobs. 

“President Donald Trump’s deputies announced Friday that they had begun the process of importing 85,000 H-1B gig workers to take white-collar jobs that will be needed after October by the millions of American graduates who are now losing jobs in the coronavirus crash.

“This is just an unspeakable action,” said Marie Larson, a co-founder of the American Workers Coalition, which opposes the many visa worker programs that have transferred at least one million white-collar jobs to foreign workers. “I don’t believe President Trump ordered this — the swamp went ahead with this,” she said.”

However, the extant to which he botched the coronavirus response was absurd. This poor response then apparently necessitated a massive $2 trillion stimulus bill to combat the economic effects. Then hell with the deficit/debt, he needed to make these problems go away to get re-elected.

No. I can't vote for him anymore. He almost completely ignored the virus until it was clear the US was not prepared at all and this started affecting stock prices. Then his response was then to brag about a $2 trillion stimulus that shouldn't have been necessary had he handled this well from day 1. 

Sorry, I can't vote for him anymore after this.",1,1585457323

You know who I feel bad for?  My boss’s friend, who will probably lose her small business running a salon due to the pandemic.  I feel bad for the doctors and nurses who died from Coronavirus because they didn’t have the proper PPE.

You know who I don’t feel sorry for? Billionaire politicians who will be fine no matter what happens.  Feeling bad for people like that is like feeling sorry for Hollywood starlets because someone was mean to them on Twitter.  It comes with the territory.",1,1585459942

He gets criticized for many things, including his brashness and unpresidential-ness. But many of the critics don’t take into account the fact that all those qualities make him who he is and add to his success. 

I didn’t vote for him to be my pastor, or a teacher, or a husband or a counselor. I voted for him to be a president. He’s the top mo-fo and he’s got the exact right personality to be the top mo-fo at this point in the history of our country. 

Do you think anyone aside from him would have been able to stand up to the left commie machine the way he had? Do you know of anyone who was running against him in the primaries on the right who could have taken the amount of abuse he’s been able to take? And through all of this he’s been kicking ass and taking names.

And nobody has been better at forcing the left to take off their masks and show themselves for the radical commies and swamp monsters they really are. Many democrat voters are waking up and seeing their own party for the swamp it’s become. And nobody but Trump could have pulled it off the way he had.",1,1585471759

796,trump,"The only thing trump accomplished was evading being imprisoned, which is miraculous given his track record. Orange man isn't bad, he is the worst. So far, he has done nothing worth praise for, especially in regards to Corona, or health in general. His efforts so far have been: give rich money, take from the poor, wreck the enconomy to participate in a cross country dick measurement contest.

I could live with a Bush Senior, Regan or even a Bush Junior, even an minor Crook like Nixon would have been better than his orange ideocracy, and I say that with all due respect, because even their terms had something of a professional conduct.

Btw, it's funny how y'all were hating on Obama and never came together to celebrate his achviements.

Put the ""idol worship"" and the crisis aside, what did trump do for the people of America? The gdp is up 4,1% (nevermind it has been on an upward trajectory since 2009.. comparison: Obama 5,1% -Clinton 7%)

Unemployment? Was on the down low before trump, his economic decisions even slowed the progress.

Wages?  First of all, im going to mention this adjusted for inflation, as wages without adjustments aren't comperable. 0,6% that's it. 
The cost of living is dramatically increasing (https://www.newsweek.com/how-much-more-expensive-it-live-biggest-cities-ten-years-ago-1069693)

Basically: for a slightly increased wage, middle and lower classes  aren't able to provide a reasonable standard of living, sometimes working two or even three jobs only to provide for their families (and yes, even collage graduates are in this cluster, which only adds student loan debt to the mentioned drawbacks)


And no, his waiver won't forgivd the student loans, only adding a ""discontinue payment until you find a new job"" option, which is nice, but seeing as you people have to pay for basically everything out of your own pocket, and less into communal funds, these kids are one illness away from catastrophy (not being able to work = more bills = forfeiture = jail/homelessness etc)

Now back to Corona: 
He threatened to leave majorly affected states behind.
He said China should have spoken about about Corvid, but removed the expert designated to inform his orange ideocracy situations like this.
He tried to buy a firm working on the coronavirus vaccine to exclusively keep the vaccine for the US.
He didn't take the threat seriously and only later stated his statements to fit the situation (https://youtu.be/HvE9hCZ-jaU)
He didn't usher in fast enough responses, as these would have decreased the infection rate majorly

 (did you guys know that the US Is currently leading in the ""overall coronavirus cases"" - even though China and India, Indonesia - all countries with comperable numbers in population have less infected?!)

He disabled and disarmed the pandemic response Obama issued, which was prepared for such an event and would have benefitted every citizen of the US. 

Also, under Obamacare, more people would have been able to afford the $1,4 test for Corona - another thing trump disabled, forcing many people to remain untested due to being unable to pay.


So yeah, seeing as it is, trump is the worst President in history.
At least William Henry Harrison was enthusiastic and a good speaker.",1,1585475825

March 2: “You take a solid flu vaccine, you don't think that could have an impact, or much of an impact, on corona?”

March 2: “A lot of things are happening, a lot of very exciting things are happening and they’re happening very rapidly.”

March 5: “The United States… has, as of now, only 129 cases… and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!”

March 6: “I think we’re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down… a tremendous job at keeping it down.”

March 6: Anybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. And the tests are beautiful…. the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect. Right? This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.”

March 6: “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it… Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”

March 6: “I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault.”

March 7: “We’ll hold tremendous rallies...I’m not concerned at all.”

March 8: “We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on coronavirus.”

March 9: “This blindsided the world.”

March 10: ""Over a million tests have been distributed,"" Pence said, and ""before the end of this week, another 4 million tests will be distributed."" (Obviously not a trump quote, but it's to illustrate how ridiculous they've been)

March 10: ""Our CoronaVirus Team has been doing a great job. Even Democrat governors have been VERY complimentary!""

March 11: ""I am fully prepared to use the full power of the Federal Government to deal with our current challenge of the CoronaVirus!""

March 12: ""108 countries are dealing with the CoronaVirus problem, some of which we are helping!""

March 13: ""Today I am declaring a national emergency. Two very big words.""

March 13. ""No, I don't take responsibility at all. Because we were given a set of circumstances, given rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time. It wasn't meant for this kind of an event, with the kind of numbers that we are talking about.""

March 13. ""We have very strong emergency powers under the Stafford Act ... I have it memorized, practically, as to the powers in that act. And if I need to do something, I'll do it. I have the right to do a lot of things that people don't even know about.""

March 15: “This is a very contagious virus. It’s incredible. But it’s something we have tremendous control over.”

March 16: “We’re going to win. And I think we’re going to win faster than people think — I hope. On a scale from 1-10, I rate my response as a 10.”

March 17: “I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic. People are dying who never died before.”

March 19: “Governors are suppose to do a lot of this work. We’re not a shipping clerk.”

March 24: : ""I do… we are doing very well with almost all the governors… \[but\] it’s a two-way street, they have to treat us well also.""

March 24: ""The Defense Production Act is in full force, but haven't had to use it because no one has said NO! Millions of masks coming as back up to States.""

March 24: Ultimately, the goal is to ease the guidelines and open things up to very large sections of our country as we near the end of our historic battle with the invisible enemy. Been going for a while, but we’ll win. We’ll win.

March 25: “You’re going to have suicides by the thousands” “People get tremendous anxiety and depression, and you have suicides over things like this when you have terrible economies. You have death. Probably and — I mean, definitely — would be in far greater numbers than the numbers that we’re talking about with regard to the virus.”

March 26: ""I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. You know, you go into major hospitals sometimes, they'll have two ventilators. And now all of a sudden they're saying can we order 30,000 ventilators?""

March 27: As usual with “this” General Motors, things just never seem to work out. They said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, “very quickly”. Now they are saying it will only be 6000, in late April, and they want top dollar. Always a mess with Mary B. Invoke “P”.

March 27: General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!! FORD, GET GOING ON VENTILATORS, FAST!!!!!! u/GeneralMotors u/Ford

March 27: Mike Pence. I mean, Mike Pence, I don’t think he sleeps anymore. These are people that should be appreciated. He calls all the governors. I tell him — I mean, I’m a different type of person — I say, 'Mike, don’t call the governor of Washington. You are wasting your time with him. Don’t call the woman in Michigan.' It doesn’t make any difference what happens.

We have over 100,000 confirmed cases which is utterly terrifying considering the fact that most people can't even get a test. More likely than not, we have closer to half a million cases and possibly even more than that.

They sell the same commodities. That's why they are called commodities you know, they are undifferentiated.

Ok

Population of the United States : 327.2 million (2018)

Population of Europe: 512.6 million (2018) so just a little higher we can adjust for the difference of population percentage (63.8)

Deaths from The Wuhan flu in the States : 3,008 (updated 21 minutes before this.

Deaths from the Wuhan flu in Europe : 26,917 (not all were update at this time)

no we are not 2 weeks behind Europe

the first case in the United States was reported Jan 21, 2020

the first case in Europe was reported Jan 24, 2020

63.8% of of 26917 =  17173.046  

So yea Trump is doing Just fine.

Europe is not Handling this as well as the United States and As you can see they have NOT flatted the curve as people are saying

It's also fairly typical of what I've come to find on the r/Republician subreddit. Call it the voice of reason, if you will. 

r/Conservative, I've found, appears to be more focused on juvenile memes, and (of more concern) something of a cesspit of bigotry. It's openly anti-LGBT, which I find abhorrant, and scratch the surface of the posters, can be quite racist too. 

Btw, just to quailfy, I'm Irish, so don't have a dog in the Democrat / Republician race. My own political leaning is centre-right (my party, Fine Gael, are currently in government - and, like myself are fiscally conservative while socially liberal. Our Taoiseach (Prime Minister) is openly gay and of Irish / Indian extraction). 

I do feel however that Trump was the wrong choice for Republican nomination. I'd far more respect for the like of McCain, who was a war hero, or Bill Weld (who is clearly highly intelligent) would serve as a better leader for the country (while probably not as popular with grassroots, I think that they wouldn't have dismantled your Pandemic infrastructure; and when Covid-19 hit, provided more decisive, intelligent leadership).

Twenty three million phone accounts went dark in China this month and you seriously think we have it the worse? Have you even seen the pictures over in India? Or how about over in Brazil? Italians are forming raiding parties to get food from grocery stores.

And when Trump went to go close to border and restrict international flights, dopey ass Biden comes out and calls it racist. Ya'll even stalled out the stimulus so you could cram the new green deal down our throats in the heat of this disaster, literally holding America hostage for pet projects.

Income taxes are not the only taxes levied on corporations.  For example, there are per-employee taxes, real estate taxes, and inventory taxes.  All those taxes must be passed on to the consumer of their products or services.

If a corporation can locate some of its assets in places where a particular type of tax is lower (or nonexistent) and the cost of doing so is lower than the cost of not having that here in the US, it will - and the employees required to service that asset will be located wherever that is, rather than in the US.

&gt; Btw you can just Google parts of your argument that you admittedly don't know. Here's an example of countries that actually have high corporate tax rates

You'll note I said ""before the Trump tax cuts"".  At the time the US had the 3rd highest corporate income tax rates of any industrialized nation.  Obviously they are lower now.

“And again, when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done”

“We have it very much under control in this country.”

I wouldn't call any of this a massive lie.

“And again, when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done”

““It’s going to disappear. One day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear.”

I don't deny Trump isn't really limited due to his car sales man shtick. 

If he all of a sudden started acting too serious it'd cause panic.

That is something you can be mad at him for.

Trumps is great at trolling people through interpersonal conflicts.

Man against man is easy, man against nature is far harder. 

Trump doesn't have the bag of tricks for this and that is unfortunate.

If one did their due diligence you knew this coming and you knew this was gonna be rough.

950,trump,"Not sure if anti-American is the right term. Her ideas are just...stupid. Like 2nd grader writing a paper on “if I were president I would...” stupid. Instead of promising people that she will give everyone a million dollars and a mansion she says “I want to give you free higher education and healthcare and we are nice so we will let anyone in who says please”. 

She wants a 70% tax on income over ten million and wants to completely abolish customs and immigration enforcement.

She isn’t an idiot and it’s not that she has surface level understanding of economics and immigration policy...it’s just that she knows the core demographic that supports her has a surface level understanding of these policies that she touts. She could never any of the things that she “stands for” passed into law. 

You can’t just cancel debt or provide “free healthcare” because it gets paid for by taxes and that increases everyone’s taxes. 

She might say her 70% tax on millionaires would solve that easily! But millionaires are usually financially educated enough to understand that there are alternative options to paying US taxes. Luxembourg- for example is used as a basic tax shelter for many large businesses like Walmart. 

Or they could simply move out of the country like they did in Venezuela when they tried to over tax the wealthy. That was very hard on the economy, as it would be in the US. I went to find an article supporting Venezuela’s collapse and coincidentally the first page of results has an article drawing a comparison to AOC’s policies to similar ones in Venezuela that collapsed their economy. [here it is ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/freebeacon.com/issues/trump-compares-ocasio-cortezs-70-percent-tax-rich-venezuela/amp/) 

So when you collapse an economy and you have all these programs that need fiscal support, you find yourself either cutting them or taxing your poor and middle class like you pinky promised that you wouldn’t. 

I don’t have to explain the reason that need to enforce customs and immigration- surely? Let’s not tank our economy *and* allow all the criminals and drug lords into the country and become Mexico 2.0. 

AOC doesn’t really believe in any of that though. If she does- she is a loony toon and the rest of America would never give her the chance to implement these policies. But it does get her name in the headlines and it wins the hearts of many people who don’t understand that policies have consequences. 

A second point though- people complain so hard about our government funded programs like public school. What makes people think that they will run colleges any better?

Paul Manafort was the only Trump associate who was specifically identified as participating in these communications.""

The only thing they weren't able to prove was that Trump had told said associated to do what they did. But who has more incentive to lie?

My uncle has advanced cancer from his time spent at the 9/11 site, and his chemo sessions have been cancelled which can kill him. However if he leaves the house and contacts the virus, he will pass. This doesn’t change 1 week from now or 1 year from now since the virus is here in the community.

So we are so focused on the today and tomorrow, and how do the numbers look. We will care more about the questions of the past when we get through this, but for now we just want leadership to guide us through this time. It is exhausting to see the top leadership of this country place blame on all other parties and even tout fake news - people are dying here!!! Because we need leadership right now more than investigations into what could have been done better, it is very reassuring to hear Gov Cuomo accept blame and responsibility for impact to NY economy, etc etc. After this is over, we will care about what could have been done better but for now we are living just waiting to get word that our family member has started to feel ill. We all feel it coming.

Trump should not be focused on his ratings and the next election cycle and what the news is saying about him.

1124,trump,"If you listen to Democrats, Trump didn’t act quickly enough and is botching the government response. Joe Biden has tried to perpetuate this falsehood by giving press briefings telling Trump what he should be doing.

The big problem with that is that when Biden has offered his own plan, he simply took things that Trump had already done, said he should do those things, and pretended they were his own ideas.

In addition to this, one of the most significant actions taken by Trump, the travel ban with China, was actually opposed by Joe Biden, and Trump’s critics on the left. Unfortunately for them, WHO experts admitted Trump’s actions saved lives in the United States.

Fox News contributor Liz Peek noted back in February, “Even before a single case of the virus erupted organically in our country [...] and even as the administration had acted preemptively and effectively to keep virus carriers out of our country, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg and others were eager to stoke fear and blame Donald Trump.”

Dr. Ronny Jackson, who served as White House physician from 2013 to 2018, also credited Trump for his decisive response to the coronavirus epidemic. ""The president has done everything he needed to do in this case,"" he said. ""He’s acted quickly and decisively. He did what he always has done ... he went with his instincts.""

Jackson added, ""What’s going on in Italy and Iran is not going to happen here I think, because of the president's quick and decisive actions. I think we are going to be more in line with what’s going on in South Korea and things of that nature.”

Who is ""in charge"" absolutely matters on matters of communication and transparency, so your point ""...Doesn’t matter who occupies the executive office"" is quite obviously invalid.

(3) ""... the **agency has refused to provide any details** about how these determinations are made or **why it is choosing to seize some supply orders and not others**. Administration officials also will not say what supplies are going to what states.""

Same point about governance.

(4) And for the kicker:

&gt;Experts say judicious use of this authority could help bring order to the medical supply market by routing critical material ... from suppliers to the federal government and then to areas of greatest need, such as New York.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yet there is little indication that federal officials are controlling the market, as **hospitals, doctors and others report paying exorbitant prices or resorting to unorthodox maneuvers to get what they need**.

So:

\- Trump tells states and **hospitals** ""get your equipment""

\- **Hospitals** and states **work hard, pay $$$** to get their own equipment

\- The administration then takes the equipment, equipment they didn't put the effort into procuring OR spent funds acquiring

\- **Hospitals** and states are left to re-bid for that equipment in a system with no transparency

That's good governance?

Finally, you say ""the feds can seize property if they want"". Yes, you are 100% correct. Let me add another correct statement to the pile: just because it's legal doesn't make it good leadership or governance.

**Governance matters.**

1135,trump,"Again, you've missed the point of my original post:

Main point: This sub decided to focus on a ""haircut"" article rather than a more important ""botched federal response"" article.

Moreover, you're proving the point that the LA Times article should be front-and-center on /r/Republican. Your reason is based on your principle that the federal government can't be trusted with disaster response. That's a debatable point, sure, but let's go with it. I'll even give you a more succinct argument you can use in a posting of the LA Times article:

1. States and hospitals were told to get supplies and were told the federal stockpile would not simply be given away. So they worked hard, spent $$$, and they did it.
2. But then the big, incompetent federal government, one run by real estate moguls with a poor record in business, seized the hard-earned supplies of the states and hospitals, leaving them only with questions on how to get some of those supplies back.
3. Therefore, the federal government, this time headed by the Trump administration, shouldn't be trusted with a response to this pandemic. So listen, Trump - let's give states more freedom and stop seizing their supplies!

You should unarguably agree with this as it's just your point. So then let's stop with partisan, do-nothing outrage articles about haircuts and get to the articles that demonstrate your real conservative principles!

I actually look forward to your comment, but I have no idea what it could be or which of my major points you'll conveneiently drop this time around.

If there is a happy resolution the dems could be caught once again flat-footed and without a cohesive agenda. The smart move for the dems is to be seen as cooperating with Trump across the board. Open up with kindness like Gandhi or the Dalai Lama. In this way the dems can be perceived as part of the solution and not part of the problem. 

Next the dems need to start converting Trump voters. Take a status quo stance on the second amendment. Allow for a moderate immigration policy. Extend an olive branch to poor white Americans. Allow some ideological diversity into their tent. 

The dems can do these things and still retain their core values. A little compromise and they could convert wide swathes of the Trump voter base.

1230,trump,"That was an incredibly dimwitted and racist response. 

You realize that reopening stuff doesn’t happen overnight? It takes more than a days preparation. Trump was preparing to lift quarantines for April 12th back in late March, and Fauci had to basically yell at him to not reopen, as that would cause a lot of new infections and make things worse.

Great work at comparing Chinatown to China, that’s incredibly simple minded and racist. You only have a problem with that because it was Pelosi. I guarantee you in any republican did that, you’d be singing praise for them.

I’ll grant you the China infection thing, especially since US intelligence (and Wuhan whistleblowers) confirmed that the real stat is much higher (plus it was kind of obvious).

America has more infected people than Italy, Spain, France, and the UK combined (and before you say anything, the combined population between those countries is roughly equal to America’s population). Of those 4 countries, Italy and Spain and starting to plateau in their infection rate, while UK and France are still way behind us in deaths per day and not raising as exponentially as we did. We’re doing worse than the bulk of Europe, where the virus went to after China.

I don’t know how else to phrase this in a way that will get through to you, but the problem is Trump. He isn’t being strict enough on this, he is too busy golfing (he’s golfed 6 times since the outbreak started in Wuhan), holding rallies (9 times since it started), and trying to privatize the postal service so he can stop mail in voting (which would flatten the curve of infection, as people would not be crammed into a poling station). He also is not allowing his hotels to be used as makeshift hospitals, nor is he allowing frontline workers to use them. He is not worried about the American people, he is worried about getting reelected so he can keep his power, and so he can keep influencing policies to enrich himself and his family.

1246,trump,"So, restricting travel from China and created a dedicated coronavirus task force in January is him downplaying the virus  and saying it is just the flu?

Perhaps he was a bit too optimistic when he had hopes that the coming spring would help to stop the virus by sometime in April. Which is what he said at the beginning of February. But, if you want a president who isn't optimistic during crisis, then I feel bad for you.

As far as calling the virus the flu, that's just straight up fake news. Has he compared it to the flu? Sure. But, it is a viral reapiratory infection. It is very similar to the flu in many ways. It is an obvious comparison to make especially in infection rates, death rates, and total death tolls. The only downplaying comments I have really seen him make are comments comparing the overall number of annual flu deaths to the covid-19 death toll. But, the fact that the total number of covid deaths is still below estimates of annual flu deaths, is not something to ignore. While the death rate may be higher for covid-19, its overall deadliness is unlikely to be much greater, if greater at all.

Trump's end goal is to keep the economy going while also mitigating the disease. Honestly, I don't think any president in the history of the USA could have handled such an unprecedented situation as well as Trump has with covid-19.",1,1586649931

Do you approve of china being able to stop critically needed supplies made by US manufacturers from being shipped here in the future? Because theve just done that.",1,1586653825
1250,trump,"The amount of early testing (or lack thereof) has nothing to do with Trump. At the beginning of February, there were approximately 400,000 testing kits for covid-19 available worldwide. 160,000 of these were created by the CDC. The CDC's testing kits, created under the supervision of Nancy Messonnier who became director of that department a year before Trump took office, had a flaw though. To be positive, they had to have a match on 3 segments of DNA from covid-19. However, even on known positive samples, results on one segment were continuously inconclusive. Because of this, the CDC was busy created a new test rather than producing more tests. Even when it was determined that just basing the diagnosis off the other 2 segments was valid, the CDC did not allow the tests to be used right away. Then, all the red tape Trump has been trying to cut in the FDA stopped private companies from being able to step in to help.

Now, after all that red tape has finally been cleared and private companies have been allowed to fix the CDC's mess, the USA has administered 2.67 million tests. More than double the number of tests administered in any other country.

As far as stricter lockdowns, the US was one of the first countries to restrict travel from heavily affected areas. And as far as stay at home orders, etc, with a country the size of the USA, those are better administered on a state or even city level. Why criminalize people in rural utah for leaving home for non-essential purposes when the only affected states are New York, Washington, Georgia and California?

For financial aid, Trump quickly sought to send financial aid to American workers but, he doesn't have that sole power. He worked well with congress to get out a stimulus package in incredible time considering hoe inefficient our Congress is about passing bills.

Additionally, I want to point out I was more so looking for specific examples rather than just a general ""well this should have been done"". The reason being (in addition to the fact that many things people complain about are things outside of Trump's power), is that while the US has the most deaths, it is sitting at about 15th right now in terms of death/capita. Many of those countries people point out as countries the US should be modeling during the pandemic are fairing much worse in terms of deaths/capita and infections/capita (USA is 19th).

To answer your last question, no. The way other countries handle COVID-19 will not change my opinion that Trump has handled it better than any previous US president would have. I feel that the reasoning for that should be obvious considering that those countries are not being ran by previous US presidents.

Additionally, I will say that in many cases, comparing specifics of COVID-19 responses between countries is complicated. Many laws, regulations, power hierarchies, etc have a large impact on the way a country can handle specific situations. I mean, Noeth Korea is a dictatorship where any infected can simply be executed and stop fuether infections. China is an oppressive communist regime and is able to lock citizens in their homes at gunpoint without an actual reason so, you can bet they can do it when there is an actual reason. European countries have significantly smaller population sizes than the US with significantly smaller landmass as well. These smaller populations and landmass allow for the entire countries government to operate at a level on par with individual states. This is because you aren't enacting strict measures on unaffected areas.",1,1586655438
1251,trump,"Thank you for your detailed thoughts. I was never saying trump has done everything wrong just that he was late to get the measures in place because he wasn’t taking it seriously. He still had rally’s in Feb and has been quoted comparing it to the flu which in turn makes the general population not take it seriously. 

You can not compare how dictatorships handled it compared to a western nation but there are plenty of other country’s like the UK, Canada and a big chunk of Europe which are comparable. I think the only way we can measure how good any country handled it is by the death per capita when all this is finally done.

1255,trump,"&gt; The problem is seeing what is happening in other country’s and then still getting large groups of people together to help the initial spread. 

My point was that at the time the virus was not prominent in the US and was not an immediate threat. There were a handful of cases. The world can't stop for that.

&gt; No doubt sanders was stupid for doing the same thing but he is not the president and I think the president should be held to the highest standard as he is the leader. 

Sanders and Biden. And lets cut the hold to a different standard bullshit. It would be one thing if Sanders and Biden were dunder mifflin salesmen. But they were running for the office of president of the United States. If you want to give Trump shit for doing something, you can't cut the opposing presidential candidate slack for doing the exact same thing.

I'm not sure how much sooner you think America should have reacted? And, as far as state specific guidelines, not sure why that blame falls to Trump.

I haven't paid much attention to the Kushner stuff. So, I'm not in a position to talk about it. I was trying to research it but, my roommate is across the room playing xbox yelling so, I wasn't really able to concentrate enough to gleam much from the articles I found. It also didn't seem like there was much actual information about it and moreso people just getting mad because its happening or maybe they they don't know what's happening ? It really just sounds like he is evaluating requests for aid and validating those requests. Perhaps nepotism but, that doesn't exactly sound like a lucrative position.

For example, you’ve been fed the idea that covid-19 is worse than the flu, but there isn’t a fact that can back it up. The numbers prove it. And that’s what Trump has been trying to convey. But because you don’t agree, it makes him a bad president. Well then why dont you step to the mic and do it better? Oh you can’t, because you’re a nobody on Reddit who throws a bitch fit at everything Trump does. Because you were conditioned to do as such.

Now everything is shut down and the virus is killing thousands and thousands of people with many more to come. Many many country’s shut down early and have manage to flatten the curve to stop the health care system collapsing. 

I never excused the Democrats for their own fuck ups but let’s be real here, there is only one president and no matter what party they belong to, they run the country and should definitely be held to a higher standard. The fact that you can dismiss something bad that Trump does with “Democrats did it” or “Democrats are worse” is absurd. The ruling party MUST be held accountable for its own fuck ups especially when your own team does it.

1260,trump,"&gt;Our points are the same that Trump didn’t act when the virus wasn’t that prominent and allowed it to get spread far and wide before they started locking everything down.

What countries shut down at an earlier point of infection than the US? Sure, the US shut down later than many countries but, Trump's actions attempting to avoid the virus helped push back the start of the infection spread in the US. And, as I have mentioned multiple times, quarantines and stay at home orders in the US were state operated procedures. Any delays in those types if shutdowns are on the state leadership. Not federal leadership. I don't think our points are the same. I'm simply trying to point out your hypocrisy as well as why your complaints aren't things Trump had control over and you're just not getting it.

&gt; I never excused the Democrats for their own fuck ups but let’s be real here, there is only one president and no matter what party they belong to, they run the country and should definitely be held to a higher standard. The fact that you can dismiss something bad that Trump does with “Democrats did it” or “Democrats are worse” is absurd. The ruling party MUST be held accountable for its own fuck ups especially when your own team does it. 

I disagree that having a campaign rally in late February/Early March was a fuck up. I think it is normal operating procedure. At that point in time, we had very few confirmed cases. I just find it ridiculous that you want to say orange man bad for Trump having a rally when the dem candidates were still having rallys as well. But, the main reason I brought that up was because corona wasn't truly a pandemic yet at that time. It was starting to pick up speed in some European countries but, was not a threat that warranted cancelling those events, especially not in the US.


&gt; Also the fact they you know Trump having his daughter and son in law in positions of power is the definition of nepotism but can’t find it within yourself to criticise him for it is worrisome. Ask yourself how you would feel if Obama had his daughter coordinate the pandemic relief with absolutely no medical or political experience? Because that is literally what is happening with all the smart and experienced people in America he chooses his son in law for an important job.

Nepotism is showing favoritism to someone when someone else, who was more qualified and willing to accept the job, was overlooked. As far as having family as senior advisers, that's not nepotism. That's just good business. An advisor has to be someone you trust and is also willing to call you on your shit while having your back. That's why family is perfect. As far at Jared's position in this coronavirus task force thing, it does not sound like it requires any medical knowledge. Anyone with that type of knowledge would be better utilized in a position that actually needed that knowledge. Especially at a time like this. Based on what I have found about Jared's position in this task force, is that he is reviewing requests for federal assistance from state and local leadership, and following up with those leaders to determine what supplies they already have to determine if the supplies are actually necessary or if they are more necessary somewhere else. That's basically a glorified stock boy. That's why I am skeptical of the nepotism claim. For it to be nepotism requires a few key things: 

1) That the position must be rewarding for the person receiving it. It can be financial reward, a better title, a better job, or a more powerful position. But, it has to have some kind of reward. 

I do not see any of those rewards being obvious here.

2.) There must be someone who is more qualified for the position that should have been offered the position but, that person was overlooked due to favoritism. Additionally, while not completely necessary but helpful for a truly solid argument, the better qualified person should also desire that position. Otherwise, the argument could be made that they were overlooked due to lack of commitment to that position.

Here, you mentioned those with medical knowledge and while sure, maybe they would be more qualified, I think they are fsr too overqualified. This task really seems more like an office administrator type of position. Something that anyone could do and not one that seems like a step up for anyone who would be in an advisory role for the president. Because of this, I am not sure that anyone was necessarily overlooked due to favoritism. In fact, I almost feel like the position really required choosing the most expendable person. Someone whose skill set was altogether too useless to utilize in any other capacity during this pandemic.

Combining what I know about his position, it does not seem like nepotism. I am open to learning more about it and potentially changing that opinion if factual arguments dissenting my opinions are presented. The same is true for anything I have said in any of my previous comments. However, if you have no specific facts to present, I don't think we will see any type of productivity from furthering this conversation since we have both thoroughly expressed our opinions on the subjects at hand.",1,1586673234
1261,trump,"Clearly not. I can't change my opinion without facts to dissent them and it seems you have none you are willing to share.

So, that should have been able to be proven by providing a few examples of specific policies you contribute to those other countries success with the countries that enacted those policies. Rather than specifics, you gave generals. Generals that were more questionable than they were factual. I had planned to investigate your specific examples but, alas I was never given a single one.

You won’t change your mind because any sources I add will be called “fake news” so I never bothered but a quick search on per capita infection rates of Canada, Australia, New Zealand against the US shows the true reality. 

Unfortunately we will be able to compare death rates in a year but that still won’t change your mind if you are not personally affected because you can’t even admit that there may be someone more qualified to coordinate a relief effort other than someone who has zero qualifications.

As far as Kushner, I am honestly confused why that was introduced into the conversation. Also, based on every source I looked at, Kushner is in no way in charge of any sort of relief effort. He is evaluating requests for aid and taking inventory. If you had actually read my responses, you would see that I did say there are likely people more qualified. But. You would also see where I said everyone who would be considered for that task would be overqualified. If you know anything about task management, then you know that if everyone is overqualified for a specific task, then you actually choose the person least qualified. Because in that case, you are squandering the least resources. Imagine you work in an office building with a CEO, CFO, a board of trustees, a VP, an office manager, and a secretary. Imagine the secretary leaves early but, left some important items that needed to be filed away. Who do you think is given the menial task? The CEO who is busy in meetings? The CFO who is busy controlling the entire companies financial future? The board of trustees that are steering the company? Or the office manager whose usual task is making sure there are enough office supplies in stock. I mean, everyone there is overly qualified for filing a few files. Its not like its rocket science. Hell, even the secretary is overqualified for it. But, rather than the most qualified person getting the task, the least important one is who is will fall to.

Kushner was likely the least qualified person that Trump still trusted enough to actually do a good job. (Sometimes people being overqualified for a job causes them to resent being given that task and then they half ass it, making it worse).

When it comes to my opinions, I am certainly biased. Of course, I form my current opinions based on previous facts. I'm not taking any high road. I'm simply stating things as I see them.",1,1586677964
1265,trump,"I started following this in December. Not much of a Reddit user at the time as the place is mostly communist propaganda and community manipulation.

Watching how it has played out is fascinating.  Seeing first subreddits appear CLO_Junkie the night the CCP gave the word go. The banning and censorship. Just insanity. And all these players thinking nobody is watching everybody is just playing.

1266,trump,"My comment was too long so, I broke it into 2 parts.
1/2

Thanks for all the quotes proving my points. You basically outlined his timeline of coronavirus action. To address some of your points. Ill only hit the high points since there is so much. (I will point out this still isn't what I was asking for, I was asking for information about what other countries were doing that you think Trump should be doing.)

&gt;“I think that's a problem that’s going to go away… They have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we’re very close to a vaccine.” Very close to a vaccine??? We are still at least 12-18 months away

In terms of vaccines, that is very close. A large amount of that time is clinical trials and all the red tape.

&gt; February 26: “The 15 (cases in the US) within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.” Total cases were 60 but ok. Glad its going down to zero though.

Not sure where you number is coming from, I doubt you're intentionally lying but, I think you may have gotten some bad info. Here is a link to an article from the CDC on that same day saying 15 cases. https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/s0226-Covid-19-spread.html

&gt; February 26: “We're going very substantially down, not up.” Completely wrong. At no point had the numbers gone down so it is a lie.

&gt; February 27: “One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.” Still waiting but again lying.


A lot of this early stuff is just optimism. Not sure why that os a big deal to some people. I guess our world just prefers pessimism. At that point in time, the virus did not seem to be spreading rapidly outside of China.

&gt; March 2: “You take a solid flu vaccine, you don't think that could have an impact, or much of an impact, on corona?” Comparing it to the flu even though it is at least 20 times more fatal.

I'm not so sure about your death rate comparison. Most valid medical sources I have seen have estimated a death rate of around 1% for coronavirus based on the current death tolls. So, that's about 10 times deadlier than the seasonal flu. Still significant but, not at least 20 times. It should also be noted, that outside of the critical strain of coronavirus, the symptoms of the common strains of coronavirus are not worse than the common strains of the seasonal flu. Even the critical strain of coronavirus isn't really any worse than critical strains of the flu. The only issue is that without a vaccine, the critical strain of coronavirus is more dangerous than critical strains of the flu because those are typically covered in the vaccines.

&gt; March 4: “If we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better.”

&gt; March 5: “I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.”

I will point out that, at least from these two statements, he technically didn't encourage people to go to work sick. He simply stated that people were doing it and still getting better. I will additionally say that depending on your working situation, it can be easily possible for many people to maintain a regular workday while sick without spreading an infection.

&gt; March 5: “The United States… has, as of now, only 129 cases… and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!”

&gt; March 6: “I think we’re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down… a tremendous job at keeping it down.”

This is around the time a lot of the major precautionary actions took place. Seems like a good early start in my opinion. 

&gt; March 6: Anybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. And the tests are beautiful…. the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect. Right? This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.” Can everyone get a test now a month after he said this?

As far as I am aware testing in the US is fine now. Trump's statement here was likely in regards to the CDC testing kits that should have been ready for use. But, there was an issue with 1 of the 3 DNA matches giving inconclusive results. Unfortunate incident. Not really a predictable issue though. It is especially frustrating though since even though the tests were still usable, the CDC hesitated to allow them to be used, stopped making more of the tests, and the FDA red tape was boxing out private testing kit production. 


&gt; March 7: “We’ll hold tremendous rallies...I’m not concerned at all.” Holding rallies with 444 confirmed cases and 19 deaths just in the US. 

You have to realize how small of a number 444 cases is right? You also have to remember that while those deaths are sad, at that time, more than 50% of the deaths were associated with a single nursing home in Washington state. Extremely high risk individuals. While, in hindsight, I agree that the time for these events to stop was coming. Even in hindsight, I don't think it was necessary at that moment. Would it have been extremely cautionary? Sure. But, not necessary. 

&gt;March 9: So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life &amp; the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that! (from a tweet) Again comparing it to the flu.

Again, not wrong. At this point, it had been roughly a month since confirmed cases had arrived in the US. 22 deaths in a month does not suggest something worse than the flu coming. I don't think any comparisons to the flu are wrong. While the death rate does seem to be a fair deal higher, the comparisons are still adequate. Compariaons to the flu work to put this in perspective, especially since the symptoms are considerably similar. However, I hold to something I have said in conversations about this subject in the past though, that is that comparisons to the flu should always be grounded by the reminder of the current lack of a vaccine for covid. The point is, you should not be that much more afraid of covid than the flu, but you should be more mindful because we do not have herd immunity from a vaccinated population. If the seasonal flu had never really existed and just suddenly popped up like this, we would be in a very similar situation probably even worse because from the studies I have seen, the flu is far more contagious. Which is why even with a lower death rate, and readily available immunization, it still kills so many people each year.

&gt; March 17: “I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.” Finally admits it is a pandemic almost 2 months after he first acknowledges it. It is also more than a month that the WHO declared it a pandemic.

WHO declared it a pandemic on March 11th. Not sure if I just misunderstood what you were trying to say. I wouldn't want to call you a liar over misunderstanding a statement like many people tend to do. As far as hin considering it a pandemic, it's a reasonable possibility. He did cut travel to China, created a specific coronavirus task force, and declared the virus a public health emergency. All before the end of January. 

On February 9th, Trump and his coronavirus task force met with governors to discuss plans for a potential outbreak.

On February 24th, he requested $2.5 billion from congress to help stop the spread of coronavirus, with $500 million of that being repurposed from a budget to fight Ebola. A request that democrats responded to with disgust because apparently Ebola was more of an issue for them than corona.

February 29th, he placed restrictions and bans on travel to Italy, South Korea, and Iran.

March 4th, Trump administration bought 500 million N95 respirators to act as a 18 month supply to fight coronavirus.

March 6th, Trump signed a $8.3 billion bill for fighting coronavirus.

March 9th, Trump called on congress to pass a payroll tax cut to help with potential economic strains on families from coronavirus.

March 10th, Trump met with top insurance providers to insure waived copays for testing.

March 11th, Restricted travel to European countries, worked to secure low interest loans for small businesses affected by the virus, directed the treasury to defer tax payments.

March 13th, declared a national emergency to gain access to $42 billion in existed funds to fight coronavirus

March 15th, all 50 states were contacted about state-led, federally supported efforts to end coronavirus.

Things being put i to motion ramped up significantly toward early March so, I left a lot of blanks. But, hopefully that gets the gist of it across.


&gt; You never answered my question before but what would your opinion be if Obama had his daughters in his administration? 

I'm not sure I exactly saw that question. I would say that if his daughters had not been teenagers then I would see no issue with them having acted as advisors. Especially if they took no salary as is the case with Kushner and Ivanka.

&gt;I think your reasoning behind kushner is pure blindness on your part. You think everyone else is over qualified and he is appropriately under qualified?? 

Perhaps I worded it poorly but, I thought I made it obvious by saying everyone would be overqualified. I was saying perhaps Kushner was the least overqualified. That is not the same thing as underqualified.

&gt; Are you suggesting that there is no one who has experience with logistics and transport that could do this job?

I am saying basically anyone who works directly with the president could do that job.

&gt; Surely a qualified person in this area would gladly step up and do their duty to help through a pandemic?

I mean... they did. Kushner...

&gt; I mean kushner is an investor and developer who only got his start when his dad was arrested for fraud, is the GOP that hard up for talented people or is it nepotism?

The dark days for Kushner. Back when he was a democrat.

1273,trump,"Trump pushing for more border security helped flatten the curve and without impeding the constitutional rights of the citizens... this helped flatten the curve even before this pandemic started. Border security is not just about illegal aliens, it's about security from disease, security from terrorists, security from drug cartels, security from espionage and so on.

Trump getting tough on China has been helping flatten the curve by getting companies to pull out of their country. This reduces business travel between the US and China (as well as, you know, not helping to fund a horrible communist, fascist, regime). Trump stopping travel from China IN JANUARY (when the WHO was still saying this is nothing to worry about and when China was still lying about their death toll) helped flatten the curve despite the bad information from the WHO and China.

Trump supporting the states in their endeavors helped flatten the curve (and he has been praised by Governors Newsome and Cuomo both for his efforts).

Trump pushing against that idiocy of people like Pelosi claiming this is all racist has helped flatten the curve. While she wasn't taking the threat seriously and saying ""Hey guys, just go hang out in China Town! Don't worry about a horrible virus, gather in large groups and in one of the most close quartered part of the city!"" Trump was closing borders and preparing.

Please explain to us how when one person is saying to take this seriously while another person is saying ""Guys, just keep partying it up!!!"" is the first person's fault.

If the people who own the companies had to pay huge fines as a penalty they would not hire illegal immigrants but because this doesn't happen is why you have illegal immigrants working here. Some companies will use illegal immigrants as cheap labor like with chicken farms for big corporations and right when the work is done they will call the feds to have them deported before they pay them.

He didn't say we don't do anything for the cure. He said we don't go into this panic mode, shutting everything down. One thing we definitely do for the flu is vaccines. Vaccines are what really allows us to not go into pandemic mode every year for the flu. Of course what we are in now is not pandemic mode. It is panic mode.

As far as the current situation, many people have panicked because of sensationalized media and they have made the situation worse. Trump has been trying to maintain the voice of reason during this whole mess but, the media thwarts it as some sort of ""virus denial"". In a pandemic, the spread of the virus can be controlled by carefully chosen closures combined with safe practices by individuals.

&gt;

&gt;“Travesty” is not a nice word. It usually is applied to gross perversions of justice, and that apparently is the context Attorney General William Barr

&gt;desired when he dropped it into an interview answer the other day in the breezy courtyard of the Department of Justice (DOJ).

&gt;His composed, understated delivery almost disguised the weighty magnitude of that disturbing word and the loaded adjective that preceded it. “I think what happened to him,” he said, referring to the president and the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation into his campaign, “was one of the greatest travesties in American history.”  

&gt;Okay, it’s important to pause for a moment and absorb what the AG said. He just called an FBI investigation not just a travesty but one of the “greatest” travesties in the nation’s history. It was an unprecedented statement by an attorney general about his own department’s premier agency.  

&gt;The FBI has made plenty of mistakes, but never in its 112-year history has an FBI investigation been characterized as a travesty, let alone one that equates to other hall-of-fame travesties in American history.

&gt;Is the AG’s assessment fair? The answer is entwined in his next statement: “Without any basis [the FBI] started this investigation into [Donald Trump

&gt;’s] campaign ... .”

&gt;Oops, stop again right there. Mr. Barr is making a definitive statement about that which many of us have speculated all along, namely that the weirdly unprecedented investigative team put together by former FBI Director James Comey

&gt;and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe

&gt;did not have adequate legal reasons to open a case into the Trump campaign in the first place. The attorney general just confirmed that.

&gt;But wait a minute, doesn’t that directly contradict DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s assertion that the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation was justified? 

&gt;Two things to keep in mind regarding that inconsistency.  

&gt;First, remember that IG Horowitz reached two primary and controversial conclusions: 1) that there was adequate justification for starting the investigation, and 2) that there was no “evidence” of political bias as a motivating factor for the investigation. He based his conclusions, according to his report, solely on his interviews of the FBI individuals who started and ran the case — from Mr. Comey on down. That’s our story, they all said, and we’re stickin’ to it. 

&gt;This would be like an FBI agent interviewing four subjects suspected of robbing a bank and, after hearing their denials, concluding there was no evidence they committed the crime.

&gt;In fairness, the IG is not a criminal investigator and certainly not steeped in counterintelligence matters. The attorney general, on the other hand, owns the Attorney General Guidelines that dictate what it takes to initiate an FBI investigation, particularly of an American citizen. He is the ultimate arbiter.  

&gt;Which leads to the second point: The AG is logically being briefed on the progress and findings of U.S. Attorney John Durham

&gt;’s investigation, which he commissioned to examine how the empty Russia collusion case got started in the first place and if it involved any wrongdoing on the part of the government. It is a safe bet that Mr. Durham is collecting evidence beyond the self-serving statements of the FBI principals involved. It also is now a safe bet that his findings will respectfully disagree with Mr. Horowitz’s.

&gt;Attorney General Barr communicates in a clear, understandable, calm-as-a-summer-evening manner uncommon in Washington. He undoubtedly did not get to his current position without being a skilled litigator, whose first rule is never make a statement to the court that you can’t back up. His newsworthy claim that there was zero basis for the FBI’s investigation stands, in all probability, on a mound of — in his words — “troubling” evidence now in his possession.

&gt;Many in the media immediately sputtered that the FBI was certainly justified because Trump campaign third-stringer George Papadopoulos

&gt;told an Australian official, in a bar, that the Russians had email dirt on Hillary Clinton

&gt;.  

&gt;The media may wish that Papadopoulos’s comment is sufficient justification to investigate a candidate for president, but it is not. An experienced Russia counterintelligence FBI agent would have recognized immediately that the Australian’s assertion, while moderately interesting for existing investigations of Russians, was not nearly enough to open an invasive investigation of American citizens.

&gt;The biased, overeager Comey and McCabe, however, opened an unprecedented full-blown investigation into a presidential campaign. Worse, Durham possibly will show that the Comey team started involving itself in questionable intelligence community activities that improperly ran confidential sources against Papadopoulos well before they officially opened a case — a potentially big no-no that, if proven, will not go well for all involved.

&gt;That is especially true in light of what the AG went on to say during his interview. He likened the Comey team’s inappropriate investigation and subsequent fallout to sabotage, or the effects of sabotage. “Sabotage” is another powerful word, technically a wartime crime, but a useful metaphor in its ramifications, since it implicates a range of supporting crimes such as conspiracy, fraud, perjury and false statements. 

&gt;The AG then ominously stated that he is not interested in simply receiving a “report” from Durham. He expects him to focus on possible criminal violations: “And if people broke the law, and we can establish that with the evidence, they will be prosecuted.”  

&gt;These are incredibly hopeful words to many Americans who have come to believe — after the 2008 Wall Street-driven financial collapse, after the numerous Clinton family schemes and scandals, and after the wasteful Mueller “investigation” — that the powerful are never held accountable.

&gt;This is an attorney general projecting an air of confidence, not afraid to speak truth to slippery politicians even though the pushback will be fierce and personal. In light of that, it’s hard to imagine his confidence isn’t buttressed with mounting evidence of abusive government actions.  

&gt;This is what the Durham investigation could well conclude: A group of people aligned with or sympathetic to one political party conspired to illicitly use the authorities of the FBI to besmirch the opposing party’s presidential candidate — and that every effort should be made to indict those who can be charged as a result.

&gt;If true, such a thing has never happened before. It would represent a direct, unprecedented attack on our democracy, to fraudulently influence the voting public with lies ostensibly emanating as facts from a noble, traditionally trusted FBI. And that, indeed, would be a travesty of historical significance. One never to be repeated, we can hope, against any future president of either party.

They weren't misinformed.  Even after we knew the information coming from China was false and that the virus was transmitting from human to human, the WHO continued to claim otherwise.  And then one of their leaders got caught in that phone call calling Taiwan part of China.  And then we learned more about others in the leadership and their history with China's propagandists in Ethopia.  Even now, the WHO has **still** refused to acknowledge that any of the information they were given by China was wrong.  When pressed on that fact, they deflected saying that they rely on reporting nations to provide timely information.  Even they aren't claiming to have been lied to by China, and if that's the line they're going to stick with then they need to be held accountable just as much as China for pushing falsehoods about the virus that led to more deaths.",1,1587033133

Feb. 23 - We have it very much under control in this country.

Feb. 24 - The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA.

Feb. 26 - So we're at a low level.

Also Feb. 26 - And again, when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down close to 0, that's a pretty good job we've done.

Also Also Feb. 26 - I think every aspect of our society should be prepared. I don't think it's going to come to that, especially with the fact that we're going down, not up. We're going very substantially down, not up.

Mar. 7 - No, I'm not concerned at all. No, we've done a great job with it.

Mar. 10 - And we're prepared, and we're doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.

There's the argument. The liberal media isn't trying to tear Trump down any more than the conservative media tried to tear down Obama. The media is always biased depending on who you listen to them. That's WHY people listen to them. People want to hear new from their perspective.

But the reality is, no media is trying to rip at Trump for ""supposedly"" downplaying the threat of CoViD-19. He DID down play it. So did the media at the time. There were absolutely people saying ""we need to take this seriously,"" but Trump wasn't one of them. Very few media outlets took it seriously either.

1441,trump,"Right, and I believe that Trump imposed the European travel ban before the states did.  There is some talk that this virus (actually I read a news article) existed in California in December, before we even knew of it.  There's an article o it too.  And while we admittedly don't know what the immediate or short-term is (regardless of what people say I have read no expert, even the CDC, say that these effects are permanent.  No one has never said we won't in the next few years be able to freely leave our house without face masks or hang out in our neighbors homes again.  That's not my concern, because I'll know we'll do it because the worst case scenario (my bigger concern is that a vaccine won't be effective and that, when told we can travel again people just won't want to do it).  But one thing I need to point out, and an area I disagree  with Trump on is it's up to the States to reopen the government, though they do need to work in collaboration with the federal government and dare I say the medical expects to reopen the business (by the way, the economy never closed...essential businesses were always open, it was partly shut down, but people could still get what they needed....though even essential businesses probably have had staff laid off.

Lastly, I will point out that I don't trust the CDC, there models were wrong, why is that?  And why should I trust Fauci?  I'm sure he's a great, capable doctor....excellent one.  The reason I don't exactly trust the CDC is this, it's a NOVEL virus.  Brand new, we don't know a thing about it.  Meaning, we don't even know if it will occur?  Is it likely or possible?  Maybe, but it's just as possible that July 4th will be here and this will disappaate.  Sadly, it's also possible (and likely) to be here forever.  That's why masks, social distancing and other measures might be a good short term solution but not a long term because a vaccine is not guarantee.  Virus change over time, and no one, not even Fauci and the other doctors know the way this will change or if it does.  Novel means brand new....in my opinion we've all been doing the best we can....even Trump.  If anyone dropped the ball it was China in telling us how serious this was.",1,1587075173

&gt; President Trump&amp;#039;s reelection committees said they have raised more than $212 million in the first three months of the year, a massive sum that boosts the president&amp;#039;s cash lead as presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden begins shifting his focus to the general election.

&gt; Trump also has other advantages, of course, such as a sophisticated &amp;quot;Virtual campaign.&amp;quot; As Jennifer Harper writes in the Washington Times, &amp;quot;President Trump has once again proven he can bypass the news media and take his message directly to the public.&amp;quot; This is, of course, why the media remain so hostile to him.

New York has 46% of the deaths in the US because Cuomo has made consistent wrong moves with the left praising the entire way. The left has blamed Trump for every single wrong during this crisis and it’s hard to not make the good news political.

I watched one of his speeches after I saw something in the news that was so asinine that I thought ""No way this is true ... no way."" 

So I watched the whole speech.

What the media said was completely a total lie, bogus to the extreme, total fabrication.

 I'm in CA.  The beaches are all closed here.  Because people were defying the 'shelter in place' order here.   It's all word salad.  I think most states have some kind of order.  Worded differently, it all comes down to the same:  people are allowed to go outside for exercise in family groups and buy food or medicine.   The pot shops are open here, but they have stopped taking out-of-state licenses and limit number of people inside.  Groceries are not limiting people.   I don't go out, I'm in 3 risk groups.  My son has gone to the grocery and he wears gloves and a mask.  I may have to have a delivery or have him shop for me soon.  I've been in my home since Mar 5, but do see my family.  They live next door and have a roommate that goes to work at the closed restaurant he is chef at because they are delivering.  So I am still being exposed to people that have to go out.  So I do social distancing with my family.  I feel more exposed than I want to be, yet how can we totally isolate? 

 Are we more closed up than you are?  

People either believe what's going on or they don't.  Left and right both, because trust me, 80% of my neighbors HATE Trump.  And they were defying the order too. 

If the media had not reported falsely that Trump called the virus a hoax, would people have stayed home?   Listen to what he said, he called the democrat attacks on his admins response a hoax.  But everyone you ask believes the media.  They constantly misquote and twist and outright manufacture what he says.  That causes damage as well.    They want his admin to fail.  They want people to die.   It's time we ALL get our act together a little better.   This isn't fun and games like the phony impeachment Nancy delivered to the Senate, thus kicking off the fun and games and 24/7 'look over here' coverage while the virus was spreading quietly in China, after a very weird and unexplanable stall, the same day Trump ordered the pandemic team to action.   WTF was up with all that?  It never has and never did make sense.   Why did she now send everyone home instead of stay in Congress and help manage this crisis by FUNDING the fight!

Oh, and it's now being reported that China limited flights out of Wuhan to destinations in China, but not OUT of China.   They knew and spread it on purpose.  Which party has influence in China?  Bidens son is still on the board he claimed to have resigned from as of this week.   More and more doesn't meet the eye.

Being a democrat doesn’t prevent you from being a good president! FDR is a great example of that.

Completely over the top.

I watched everybody I used to agree with on the left get all wrapped up in horribly racist nonsense they thought was woke, talk endlessly about how trump colluded with russia (I believed it for a little bit) only for that to be a giant nothingburger, saw them make up complete fake bullshit about a SCOTUS nominee and act like it was real, this waste of the few good months of the term on impeachment all things for an entirely different nothing burger.

I was utterly mortified to see what my party had become, I never realized they were that insane.  And when your perspective changes like that you begin to see the past in a different light as well.  Nothing I thought I knew about politics looks the same to me anymore.

I'm not a republican either, but I can't think of but a handful of (local) democrats I could ever vote for.  TDS is real, people have lost their damn minds.  It's mass hysteria.  And I can't vote for anybody that doesn't acknowledge that hysteria.  It's obvious.",1,1587244540

It’s — I said, ‘What happened to Denver?’

Where were you? How many people did you meet? Were you out to dinner in somebody else’s home? Where were you?’ Where did — where did this number of people come from? How did — they are totally on it.

You know the problems I’m talking about. There’s a whole genius to it.

“We’re fighting — not only is it hidden, but it’s very smart. Okay? It’s invisible and it’s hidden, but it’s — it’s very smart. And you see that in a case like a Denver.

China’s Bio weapon, and Pelosi.. My wife Angie will tell you that I study history and world events fluently every day. I have studied China for many years. To get answers I need to questions, I call many I know in Washington on Capitol Hill (from my tenure on two Presidential campaigns and Presidential talks) and I ask them for straight up answers to better understand what affects us as a nation.

Well, in 2016 America elected a new Sheriff: Donald J Trump. For decades the Chinese walked all over America but the new President said “not anymore”. Trump literally strangled China’s economy to the point their economy was in its worst free fall ever. Trump negotiated a new 50 billion trade agreement. He had Xi by the proverbial balls. America’s economy was on fire and unstoppable. President Xi Jingping knew he could not beat the USA militarily and he knew any domesticated economic attack would fail as our economy was too strong. He had to act. But how?

Enter the USA democrats led by Pelosi and Schiff. Impeachment. A hoax. A distraction for our people and President. Xi Jingping and his thugs see this. They aren’t stupid. They have very intelligent intellectual thinkers in their government. Now you must understand , the Chinese regime are truly Barbarians. Notice I did not say ALL CHINESE. The Chinese people are a good people. I enjoy my interactions with them.

The communist regime has millions of its own citizens slaving in gulags simply for speaking against the government or openly practicing Christianity. Knowing they could not attack us openly they needed to be coy, like a deceptive fox. In my opinion, I believe the regime released a biological weapon upon the world that doesn’t kill everyone, but kills “enough,” especially the elderly and in-firmed. Back in WW 2 Hitler thought the same way. He got rid of what he considered the useless and rejects of society.

Trumps task force uses models to figure things. Xi used and uses “models” too. China's president figured that if he killed a few of his own (a few hundred thousand to them would be a few out of 1.4 billion people) and spread the virus to other nations (especially to the USA) they would “level the economic playing field” and not have fired a shot.

Losses of his own people were acceptable costs of a new war. When China’s own doctors attempted to sound the warning, they were immediately silenced. In fact one died and another has simply disappeared. Trump and the other allied leaders indeed KNOW this is what happened. They have under reported their own deaths. Trump knows he cannot outrightly seek retribution. His news conference today showed me this when he balked publicly about no outright retribution over Xi’s handling of this and he immediately brought up the “trade deal”. However, Trump wasn’t being weak, he too was now being coy. We know this was a biological weapon. The food market story is bullshit.

Xi knows we know it. Trump also today announced he sent two battle groups of destroyers and other ships to sea several days ago to fight drugs and rogue actors like Iran should they try anything.

I say he did this to show Xi he knows what has transpired (we have the greatest intelligence assets) and that they (the Chinese) should rethink further action. Politics is premier. We cannot overtly attack China for what they have done as we would also suffer greatly. We all know this.

But China has temporarily achieved its goal. America was literally consumed by Trumps phony impeachment brought by the ultra left democrats (supported by democrat rank and file and one Republican Mitt Romney) and Xi Jingping saw an opening. He took it. Xi did what Trump usually does...he walked onto the world stage and threw a grenade into the “room” and left. It exploded in the form of this worldwide pandemic. It brought the USA and the rest of the world to its knees and leveled the economic playing field.

Our economy is now near depression. Xi didn’t fire one bullet. Trump needed to up his game of chess and putting our Naval ships to sea was his next move. He said he is a “war” President. He is.

But now on not one but two fronts. One front is the virus and the other front is the Chinese. While the Saudi’s and Russians are screwing with oil prices they aren’t overtly doing what this pandemic is doing. The drug smuggling story for dispatching the Naval Force is bullshit and the world knows it. I am of the opinion Trump can indeed bring us back from this catastrophe albeit with a changed playing field.

But Trump is a genius in chess and financial matters. He’s become a champ at international politics too. I am sure Trump can once again lead the economy to even stronger strength and greatness the it was . He can do it quickly I’m sure of it. He has proved it. Xi Jingping needs to be sent a message loud and clear. NEVER AGAIN. We need to bring all of our critical manufacturing back from China beginning with our medicines they were recently threatening to withhold. We can do it immediately. Again, another reason for Trump putting to sea such a sizable Naval Force. Sending a clear message.

We all must ride out the next few weeks. Then we and the world pick up the pieces and move on. The democrats who have given Xi this opening wrapped in a bow must pay a heavy price in November as they (the democrats) truly have cost and continue to cost America precious lives by the phony scandals. Nancy Pelosi continues to help the Chinese by her daily shameless attacks upon the President and meddling in stimulus packages as she did this last weekend. Yesterday’s statements she made were truly appalling and the lowest of low. I didn’t think she could go any lower. What a disgrace she is to our nation.

But, Pelosi aside, make no mistake, China must and will be taught a lesson the likes they have never seen before and Trump is the man to pull the trigger.

We the people must teach the democrats the same lesson at the polls. They (the radical wing of the party) are the enemy of a free America. I am certain of it. The entire democrat party of our forefathers is dead. Remember people, Trump indeed tried to warn us all of the Conavirus in his State of the Union Speech. He spoke of it. He said he was on top of it.

After he spoke , Nancy Pelosi ripped up the speech calling Trumps words “a manifesto of lies”. She disgraced the country and all of our fellow honored citizens present in the House Chamber. Well she now has American blood on her hands. She is very majorly responsible for these needless deaths as well as the Chinese. Her and Adam Schiff.

The left and democrats laughed as she tore up his speech. Well, as they laughed the disease he just spoke of in that speech came to our shores. Republicans and Democrats alike are now dying. Your family members and mine. Our grandparents and middle aged citizens alike. Bodies are being loaded in trucks with forklifts in Brooklyn outside of hospitals. No one is safe. Our liberty is for the most part suspended. As we bury our dead (without proper funerals) from this calamity let’s drive the nails into the coffin of the Democrat party as well in November.

It’s time people. Stand up for your rights and your country! Our Liberty and survival is at stake! I am praying for God’s blessing on our nation. But, God also gave us the ability to think for ourselves and it’s time we placed blame for all this death where it belongs: on the doorsteps of Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff and Xi Jingping directly. Wake Up America.  WAKE UP!

Let me explain. We all know that Trump isn't a doctor. At no point has he ever claimed to be a doctor. Yes... he touts his intellect a lot, but he's not a doctor. However, he's meeting with LOTS of doctors right now and they are likely discussing MANY possible treatments.

For the media to claim that Trump has said people should inject themselves with disinfectant is DANGEROUS.

Consider this. When he talked about ""hydroxychloroquine"" (because there had been reports of positive impacts from it) and some dude died because he took (or was given) fish tank cleaner...they blamed Trump. They said Trump had blood on his hands because this dude died from taking fish cleaner.

Considering that they think Trump has the magical power to induce people to do the things that he suggests....WHY would they misreport this and say that he suggested injecting ""disinfectant"".

If someone DOES to it and dies or has adverse effects, that will be the fault of the MEDIA and not Trump.

Here's what he said after a doctor talked about what kills the virus. Sunlight and isopropyl alcohol are best and a lab is studying that...the virus in secretions, Trump asks the doctor, talking about all of this research and what it means...

""Can I ask a question because some of you are wondering...supposing we hit the body with a tremendous whether it's UV or powerful light and I think you said that hasn't been checked but you are going to test it and suppose you get the light inside the body and you said you are going to check that and about the disinfectant can you do something with that injection inside or with a cleaning in the lungs because it gets inside the lungs and you said that the lab's going to check that...""

So this isn't Trump saying, ""INJECT YOURSELF WITH DISINFECTANT""...this is Trump recounting the conversation he had with the doctor regarding where their TESTING is going to go next in light of their FINDINGS about how sunlight and disinfectant kills the virus....

He lies a little bit but not blatantly.

Summation:

Trumps is straightforward and speaks directly because he is hyperbolic and tells half truths.

I'd love to be able to understand how your brain works.",1,1588004725
1836,trump,Because it's easier to blame Trump rather than pin the blame on the CCP. That's how much the left hates him.,1,1588004951
1837,trump,“And then I see the disinfectant. Where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way where we can do something like that? By injection inside or or almost a cleaning because you see it gets inside the lungs and does a tremendous number in the lungs.” -Donald J. Trump @ 2:09,1,1588005456
1838,trump,You want Trump to run against Bernie?,1,1588005675

1840,trump,"Our current administration did not appoint a WHO representative for 3 years. As the largest contributor to the WHO, the US could have had a major say in the way this all played out. But since that didn't happen, China got away with a lot. 

We should all blame china for the crimes committed against humanity but we should simply see the our great country failed this time.

1841,trump,Yeah all hes done is cause confusion. Keeping his mouth shut and asking someone who will actually own what he says might be a start. Pence would be far better. Trump has already likely killed some with his awful way of speaking at people,1,1588007023
1842,trump,"Tens of thousands are dying. Hospitals are overwhelmed. PPE and ventilators are being strained. 

Stay at home orders shift the curve down. People will die, yes, but we can change how many die by tens of thousands if we practice social distancing. How many lives is opening up the nation earlier worth to you? Polls show that a majority of Americans (even a majority of Republicans) are more worried about opening up too early rather than dragging it out too long. 

Trump and the loudest on the right is not all Republicans. Violating stay at home is risking not only your life, but your the lives of your family and the community. This isn't some Democratic ploy. If it were, there wouldn't be similar policies in so many other countries. Pay attention to the scientists. This is their job.",1,1588007393
1843,trump,"China does this over petty shit. 

Norway exports fish to china, salmon mostly I think. We've had several instances where the Norwegian Government has said or done something that displeases China. Like endorsing a chinese Nobel Prize winner, or mentioning anything about their internal politics at all. 

BOOOOOM, China goes all out and does a trade embargo. 

5-6 months later the press doesn't give a fuck, and china eases up. Meanwhile, Norwegian traders have found new markets to trade with. Much like Trump does to China. 

Wutang Clan aint nothing to export fish with. Diversify your haul bro!?",1,1588011199

  This is the same “rules for radicals” tactics the liberal media uses to discredit anyone who even slightly differs from the media narrative. 
   The media loves to Claim Trump doesn’t listen to his scientific advisors. Who’s the one not listening? I believe it’s Andrea Mitchell and Chuck Todd in this instance. 
  Sadly most people believe this Fake News!",1,1588016622

1849,trump,"Sure, like she wanted to rush the impeachment process, but then changed her 'opinion' to hold onto the articles.

Like she said we should ""believe all women"" during the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings, but has changed her 'opinion' and endorsed Joe Biden.

Like she was against Trump stopping travel from China, but changed her 'opinion' and now says he should have done more.

She changes her 'opinion' when it's politically convenient.",1,1588030128

1851,trump,"Obama terms saw an increase of about 6.8 trillion to the national debt, so far, trump is sitting at around 3 trillion increase. So less, but expect it to jump up with coronavirus costs.

1852,trump,Pot calling the kettle black much? We're not the party that gave the world Donald J. Trump 🙄 who btw has been accused of over 20 sexual assaults... so... Where's your outrage at that?,1,1588072761
1853,trump,Doesn’t Trump have like over two dozen sexual misconduct allegations against him? Biden’s a shitbag but hypocrisy goes both ways here.,1,1588075016
1854,trump,"We, at least in the USA, need time to get our house in order.  We rely far too much on medicine, aside from medical supplies, coming from China.   If they wanted to strangle our healthcare system, through medicine, they could do this.   It needs to be a critical factor in the presidential race.   As much as I disliked a lot of Dick Gephart's politics, he was correct even back in 1988 and 2004 as to getting away from China.   Yet, the establishment never-Trumpers and democrats have continued to call Trump a xenophobic racist.   Gephart was quietly called the same in 2004.",1,1588101100
1855,trump,"The taking the high road has been a Republican thing for a really long time. I for one am sick of it. To beat a pig in a wrestling match requires you to roll around in the mud. As much as I adore Ben Carson and Ted Cruz they couldn’t have beat Hillary because they didn’t know how to roll around in the mud and are actual gentlemen. Hillary was a pig and Trump wasn’t afraid of the mud and beat her. 

What they did to Kavanaugh was unforgivable. Biden is a POS and there are credible allegations. We should investigate the fool out of those.",1,1588116978
1856,trump,That’s exactly why Trump was elected. That’s what he was elected for.,5,1588117970

Which is meaningless. Jail time or it's nothing.",1,1588209638
1862,trump,"This is going to be up to Barr and the trail left. He's assembling the ""Mueller"" squad and Justice will move if evidence found.  Tip of the iceberg.  An excellent political thriller is on the way.    Very pleased with Barr.
If you recall Jeff Sessions getting fired by Trump - obviously frustrated with his inability to do what Barr has done, find the truth and actually move the ball forward.  
This won't be overlooked by Justice.
And this explains so much about the leaking early - actively underming the POTUS by creating discord in the admin.

Redditors are largely young and the platform is icky with bots of opinion suppression.  Smart and young.  Not intellectually honest and not yet wise.",1,1588222155

1866,trump,It’s hard to comprehend how hypocritical Biden is about his secrecy talking to foreign leaders when Biden and the left demand to know what was said and investigate Trump every time time he utters a word to any foreign leader.,1,1588361551
1867,trump,That's different they have to know what was said by Trump in order to get rid of him. He could literally cure cancer and the left would claim he did something wrong.,1,1588363584
1868,trump,"So you are saying Biden is equivalent to trump?

Nice to finally hear you admit this.  

I will go with the known commodity, not the demented one cheating his kids into multimillionaire jobs in the Ukraine and China.",1,1588363707
1869,trump,"He isn't dear leader, I promise I don't worship the ground he walks on. That's fine but it isn't a first come first serve thing they can be investigated at the same time. Why do you insist on Trump being investigated but not Biden. Also you tried to compare hookers to sexual assault, those are entirely different.",1,1588364991
1870,trump,"Weeellll even though I think they should be allowed to search for just Tara Reades name I do think there’s stuff that we don’t need to know or shouldn’t know. Same thing with Trump, I’m sure just a lot of ways he got deals done that weren’t necessarily illegal but that people don’t need to know about. 

Some things do need to remain confidential as part of the job. Not necessarily proprietary information but if other countries knew that every conversation would be released in the US...we would never get anything done with them.",1,1588366493
1871,trump,"I’m one. 15 technically. I have my politics from my parents but I do have things to say about other people.

So I have been a Republican my whole life. But since I’m a teenager and my parents are getting more and more annoying, I decided to not get involved in Politics since I don’t want to be some crazy kid. I beleive that I’m a little bit smarter then some conservatives because I think before I take action fot certain stuff. Some conservatt would use Mob logic and just do whatever. 

Other people from school, a few months ago, I talked about their opinion about politics and I found something weird. 

So I have 2 groups. A and B. Group A are the weird kids. Gothic like, Trans, and Gay. All of their parents either abounden them or think their garbage. I know this because I talk to then about their lives. I also relized that most of then have conservarive parents since one use to study the bible with her daughter, and others think that their child is nothing like what they wanted originally. And since these kids are Softmores, they’re really rebellious. Group B is more relaxed since they worked with their parents and have a good relationship. If you want to know more, then plz reply.

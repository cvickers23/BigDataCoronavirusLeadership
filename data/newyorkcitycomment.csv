24,cuomo,"&gt;Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declared a state of emergency on Saturday as the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in New York rose to 76.  
&gt;  
&gt;The governor’s announcement came as concerns about the spread of the virus increased in New York City, which has 11 confirmed cases. The newest one appeared to involve a driver for taxi or ride-sharing services in Queens, officials said.  
&gt;  
&gt;The epicenter of cases in New York continued to be just north of the city, in Westchester County, where there were 57 in total, the governor said. These cases were mostly, if not all, related to a cluster in Westchester that first came to the authorities’ attention [after a New Rochelle resident, a 50-year-old lawyer, was confirmed as New York’s second coronavirus patient](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/nyregion/new-rochelle-coronavirus.html).  
&gt;  
&gt;But there were also signs of wider spread, including a pair of cases in Saratoga County, north of the state capital of Albany — the first such confirmed cases outside of the New York City region.  
&gt;  
&gt;The declaration of emergency will allow the state to speed up the purchasing of supplies and the hiring of workers to assist local health departments that have been handling the monitoring of thousands of self-quarantined patients, Mr. Cuomo said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Somebody has to go knock on their door, once a day,” he said during a midday briefing in the state Capitol. “This is labor intensive.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The declaration would also allow officials to skirt purchasing regulations, if necessary, he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;New accounts of infection continued to emerge. On Friday night, the driver in Queens tested positive, and the discovery of the case prompted more than 40 doctors, nurses and other workers at a hospital there to go into self-quarantine over fears that they might have been exposed to the coronavirus, officials said on Saturday.  
&gt;  
&gt;The man, 33, walked into St. John’s Episcopal Hospital in the Far Rockaway section of Queens on Tuesday and reported flulike symptoms. He went home and returned later when his symptoms worsened, an official said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dozens of workers at the hospital are now being tested, officials said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Obviously, 40 people are out,” said Councilman Donovan Richards Jr., a Democrat who represents Far Rockaway. “The hospital will need to replace those people temporarily. They will need money to do that. They need supplies. We need to keep the health care up and running.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Tom Melillo, a hospital spokesman, said that the patient remained in quarantine at the hospital on Saturday, and that hospital officials were monitoring everyone who may have been exposed to the patient.  
&gt;  
&gt;It was not immediately clear whether the man drives a yellow taxi or works for ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft. Representatives with Uber, Lyft and the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission all said that officials had not reported that one of their drivers had tested positive for the virus.  
&gt;  
&gt;Health officials said they were also seeking to determine whether the driver may have exposed passengers.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also on Saturday, the governor of Connecticut, Ned Lamont, said a New York doctor who commutes to work at Bridgeport Hospital tested positive to the illness. Mr. Lamont said the physician did not show visible symptoms while treating patients and isolated himself.  
&gt;  
&gt;On Friday, [New York City officials asked the federal government](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/testing-coronavirus.html) to send more diagnostic kits for the coronavirus, saying in a letter that the city’s limited capacity to test had “impeded our ability to beat back this epidemic.”  
&gt;  
&gt;In tracing people who had contact with the New Rochelle man, a partner at a small Midtown Manhattan law firm, disease detectives learned that he had attended synagogue services before becoming infected.  
&gt;  
&gt;Public health officials closed the synagogue, Young Israel of New Rochelle, and asked that anyone who had attended services, a bat mitzvah or a funeral there recently isolate themselves as a precaution.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Cuomo did not say on Saturday how many New Yorkers were now isolating themselves at home over fears they might have been exposed to the virus. But as of Friday, New York officials said they had asked about 4,000 people in the state to self-quarantine.  
&gt;  
&gt;About 2,700 of that quarantined group were in New York City, and most of them had recently returned from five countries where the outbreak has been most severe: China, Iran, Italy, Japan and South Korea.  
&gt;  
&gt;At least 44 people in New York State had been placed under mandatory quarantine as of Friday, including 33 in Westchester County, nine in New York City, one in Nassau County on Long Island and one in Erie County in Western New York.  
&gt;  
&gt;In his remarks on Saturday, Mr. Cuomo said the state was aggressively testing as many people as possible. “We want to find positives,” the governor said, adding that while some people might be disconcerted by the rising number of patients, it showed that the solid medical detective work was underway. “We say, ‘That’s good news, that we know who the people are.”  
&gt;  
&gt;New Jersey officials said on Friday that four people in the state had tested positive for the virus: a 32-year-old man, a man in his 50s and a woman in her 30s, all from Bergen County near New York; and a man in his 60s from Camden County, in the southern part of the state.  
&gt;

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declared a state of emergency on Saturday as the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in New York rose to 76.

UPDATE: We have learned of new confirmed cases of #Coronavirus in NYS bringing the total number of cases to 76.

- 57 cases in Westchester County
- 11 cases in NYC
- 4 cases in Nassau County
- 2 cases in Rockland County

27,cuomo,"There's a lot of data they don't have, like how many people got sick with this disease that we haven't even heard about and how many people have died from it and the deaths have not been attributed to it. So they don't know what the mortality rate is with any precision. It could be that 2% number. It could be that 3.4% number. It could be less than 1%.

But Cuomo said today that it looks like 80% of the people who get Covidd-19 self resolve and the other 20% require hospitalization.

Epidemiologists probably have seen enough clusters to come to that sort of conclusion with a fair amount of accuracy. They get to evaluate how spouses and family members do after someone is determined to definitely have this disease, etc.",3,1583609301
28,cuomo,"&gt;But Cuomo said today that it looks like 80% of the people who get Covidd-19 self resolve and the other 20% require hospitalization.

Does anyone know if that seems to be an accurate number for symptomatic cases only, or is it accounting for estimates of asymptomatic/unrecognised cases?",3,1583611934
29,cuomo,Cuomo looked worried and stressed out on TV today.,4,1583612798
30,cuomo,"“‘You know what’s worse than the virus? The anxiety,’ Mr. Cuomo said, noting that most patients would suffer mild or no symptoms.”

Astonishing. Spoken like someone who doesn’t feel threatened by the virus. This is a stupidly insensitive thing to say - THE VIRUS IS WORSE Moron!!  My mom looked me in the eyes the other night and said calmly “if I do get this virus, I probably won’t make it”...and as a diabetic, heart condition and COPD sufferer already fighting bronchitis from a seasonal cold, she’s probably not wrong. So yeah...maybe most of us won’t die from this. But people WILL die, and that’s astronomically worse than a little well-placed anxiety and caution.",8,1583614065
31,cuomo,"&gt; So yeah...maybe most of us won’t die from this. But people WILL die, and that’s astronomically worse than a little well-placed anxiety and caution.

Cuomo also said that around 20% who get it need to be hospitalized.

Anyone hanging their hat on thinking that only one in fifty people die and expecting it to be someone else is in quite a bit of denial.",4,1583615366

41,cuomo,"Out of genuine curiosity why do people like Cuomo? He’s a crook, pushed out the one person who could have really saved our mass transit system. What’s something that made people still believe he was a good candidate to be governor?",1,1583713148
42,cuomo,it just highlights how out of touch with reality cuomo is. finding a subway car that isn't crowded in morning or evening rush is impossible,1,1583713619
43,cuomo,"Because all New York voters see is Democrat good, Republican bad. So a shitty Dem incumbent will never lose an election in this state / city and is effectively unaccountable to voters. Until we start giving these guys serious primary challenges on the regular (Cynthia Nixon was a start, but needs to look more like AOC and score some primary wins) or Republicans return to serious contention, this is the way politics in NY will go. So why would Cuomo be anything other than an egotistical bully when he knows he runs the state completely unchecked?",1,1583716185
44,cuomo,This is the planted social discord that allows corruption to continue. It's better for Cuomo if you believe Buffalo is made of igloos and melts for two weeks in August and Albany is full of empty factories and tweaker dens. NYC is all hookers and muggers. Everyone look at each other while the conman slips away.,1,1583767270
45,cuomo,"In such circumstances, it’s in everyone to treat the Democratic Primary as seriously as the Governor election, and to get out the vote and really examine the runners and riders. Cuomo didn’t get in on a real platform, he’s a legacy in, and that should have been far more fiercely contested. But that requires decent candidates to stand, and Cynthia Nixon wasn’t that.",1,1583767881

Maybe Trump is too stupid to process this, but De Blasio and Cuomo know. They won't lock things down though, because they need the public to see the bodies piling up in order to accept mass closures of businesses. Some of which businesses might survive if we lock things down NOW when the numbers are what they are, and not 3 weeks from now when the numbers are what they will be.

Today Cuomo told people to ""settle down for a months long quarantine,"" suggesting that the lockdown could last up to 10 months. He knows, while saying this, that there are millions of people out there to whom a 10 month lockdown would mean destitution or death. He knows that for a lot of people it's one of their worst possible fears come true. And in the process, he (and other leaders, and the media) are stressing already stressed people to the point where it's going to severely [weaken their immune systems](https://www.apa.org/research/action/immune), leaving them more susceptible to the virus. Not one of these bastards cares about the mass psychological consequences of their statements, and they don't seem to care about the unprecedented economic collapse and poverty which would result from a 10 month (or even 4 month) lockdown. People like Cuomo talk like this from the pedestals of their safe, prosperous lives of security and stability. A 10 month lockdown wouldn't send Cuomo or anyone like him onto the streets in homelessness. They have their bunkers, their many homes, all stocked with supplies and with people bustling around them doing everything for them. Hey, can't let ME face destitution, because I'M important and the public needs me! Fuck off. 

And why do they do this? Because essentially, a time like this is a golden opportunity for people in power and the media. For politicians like Cuomo, it gives them a chance to posture as a wartime leader, someone who will be ""praised for his performance under a national crisis"" and what have you. So they have to continually represent the pandemic as the worst possible case scenario, so that people will be terrified and look to them for help. A frighted populace = more power than these politicians have ever had, and they're drunk on it. For the media, a panicked audience = more page clicks and ad revenue.

**Rhode Island begins door to door checks for New Yorkers fleeing coronavirus**

WESTERLY, RI — The Rhode Island National Guard started going door to door on Saturday in coastal areas to inform any [New Yorkers who may have come to the state](https://nypost.com/2020/03/28/rhode-island-sending-cops-national-guard-to-find-new-yorkers-seeking-coronavirus-refuge/) that they must self-quarantine for 14 days while Gov. Gina Raimondo expanded the mandatory self-quarantine to anyone visiting the state.

Raimondo also ordered residents to stay at home, with exceptions for getting food, medicines or going to the doctor, and ordered nonessential retail businesses to close Monday until April 13 to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. She also directed realtors and hotel operators to include new requirements that any out-of-state residents must quarantine for 14 days in their purchase agreements.

State Police set up a checkpoint on I-95 in Hope Valley on Friday where drivers with New York license plates must stop and provide contact information and were told to self-quarantine for two weeks, WPRI.com reported.

If New Yorkers don’t comply, they face fines and jail time, Raimondo said, adding that that’s not the goal.
“I want to be crystal clear about this: If you’re coming to Rhode Island from New York you are ordered into quarantine. The reason for that is because more than half of the cases of coronavirus in America are in New York,” Raimondo said, adding that it’s not meant to be discriminatory.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo called the order “reactionary” and unconstitutional, saying he’d sue Rhode Island if the policy isn’t rescinded but believed they could “work it out.”

“I understand the goal … but there’s a point of absurdity, and I think what Rhode Island did is at that point of absurdity,” said Cuomo, a Democrat. “We have to keep the ideas and the policies we implement positive rather than reactionary and emotional.”

President Donald Trump said Saturday that he had spoken with some governors and was considering some type of a quarantine to prevent people in New York and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut from traveling. Trump Late Saturday, though, he tweeted that a travel advisory should be administered and not a quarantine.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbot on Thursday joined other states in imposing quarantines on air travelers from the New York area, including New Jersey and Connecticut, and New Orleans, two places where COVID-19 outbreak is more severe. The Republican said travelers who don’t comply with the 14-day quarantine risk jail time, adding that state troopers would conduct visits to make sure people were staying put.
In Rhode Island, which reported its first two deaths from COVID-19 on Saturday, a team of a Westerly police officer and a Guard member were visiting stately and modest coastal homes in the Westerly neighborhood of Watch Hill collecting contact information from New Yorkers and telling them to self-quarantine. They expected to go to about 1,000 homes over a few days.

“This is more of an education tool to make people aware and comply with what we are asking them to do,” said Westerly, Rhode Island, police chief Shawn Lacey. “We are certainly hope it doesn’t get to enforcement action that has to happen.”

Reha Kocatas, a New Yorker who arrived March 22 from the Bahamas to his Rhode Island home, said his wife and two children were visited by a police officer and a national guardsmen. Already under a 14-day quarantine per a state order because he had arrived from outside the 50 states and the District of Columbia, Kocatas said he volunteered information to the authorities including the number of people in the home, when they entered Rhode Island and his and his wife’s date of birth.
But he questioned why it was necessary to send a police officer to his door.

“It seemed like a pretty large waste of resources for something that could have been volunteered through an online form pretty quickly,” he said.

“If New Yorkers are such high risk individuals, why are we putting first responders in front of these individuals is a little questionable since there is no action item at the end of the day,” he continued. “They weren’t going to remove us. It seemed like bureaucratic grandstanding. The local community that happens to be here believes that it’s a waste of precious resources when time is the essence in preparing for other things.”

More so because stopping every car / going to every house is likely to infect a cop. Then that cop is going to infect everyone he stops / visits. This is a net negative idea. 

But seemingly, Americans love a strong man and doing pointless shit that makes the problem worse has absolutely been a success for Trump, so here we are.

&gt; And then you have to consider that fact the reason NY's case count is so high is because the state has been testing at a far higher rate than any other state,

That's not certain as best I can tell. Hospital admissions are mostly immune from a lack of testing, more so if you count flu admission in your number. NYS hospital admission numbers are high. What's interesting is no one seems to be noticing so are GA and LA.",1,1585509290

Now he is complaining he doesn't have enough ventilators, and is simultaneously begging the feds for more and blaming them for his shortage.

As for starting weeks ago, no one even started complaining that they needed more to address the current situation until NY did about 2 weeks ago, at which time the process for acquiring them was immediately started by the feds. 

The feds' job is to help the states acquire the supply of items that they identify as being necessary and lacking. Gotta figure out what you want before someone can get it for you.

The article:

&gt;Elmhurst Hospital Center is being provided with critically needed supplies and resources to help with the overwhelming influx of coronavirus patients the hospital experienced last week, as Mayor Bill de Blasio warned the city could be out of ventilators and other medical equipment without more federal help by Sunday, April 5.

&gt;“Elmhurst Hospital and our NYC Health + Hospital system are at the center of this epidemic,” said Mayor de Blasio in a March 29 press release. “We’re in a state of war, but we cannot go into battle without ammunition,” he said, adding, “To those who are on the frontlines: Your city is behind you, and more help is on the way.”

&gt;“In the last week we have seen real (federal) support,” said de Blasio on Sunday, March 29. “The fact is we remain the epicenter of this crisis – the numbers are staggering,” he said, adding the goal was to have 400 more ventilators by April 1. The city has now received 2,500 ventilators from the federal government and is distributing them to hospitals as needed.

&gt;The city is also distributing 250,000 surgical masks donated by the United Nations (UN) to help protect healthcare workers. Elmhurst Hospital has received a total of 21,000 N95 masks, 18,000 head coverings and 2,000 booties, 221,000 surgical gloves, 33,000 face masks, 17,500 gowns, and 1,665 face shields.

&gt;On March 29, Governor Andrew Cuomo extended his March 20 executive order directing nonessential workers to work from home and the requirement to maintain 6 feet of distance in public for an additional two weeks through April 15, but the month of March was very hard on the borough of Queens.

&gt;Since the first coronavirus death was confirmed on March 14, a total of 33,714 cases have been recorded citywide with 776 deaths, according to the New York City Department of Health as of Sunday, March 29 at 4:15 pm, and was expected to have surpassed 1,000 by Monday, March 30. Queens had almost a third (10,737 or 32 percent) of the total and suffered the greatest loss of life in the city with 253 deaths.

&gt;On March 28, Governor Cuomo announced that the federal government has approved Aqueduct Racetrack as one of four new sites for temporary hospitals to be constructed by the Army Corps of Engineers, adding 1,000 beds in Queens.

&gt;“There is no state in the nation that is better prepared or better mobilized to combat this virus than New York,” said Governor Cuomo. “The number of cases is still going up towards the apex, and the development of new, faster tests will be critical in flattening this curve, getting people back to work and returning to normalcy,” he said at his Sunday morning press briefing on March 29.

&gt;Cuomo reported 59,513 coronavirus cases with 965 deaths statewide occurring in 44 of New York State’s 46 counties, including the five counties of New York City. “New York is the number one impacted state,” he said. New Jersey, with 13,386 cases and 161 deaths, is a distant second. The first coronavirus case was identified in the US in Washington state on January 21, spreading to all 50 states and the District of Columbia by March 17. There are now 139,523 cases and 2,433 deaths as of March 29.",3,1585775774

Did you know that the task force told the governor he would never have enough ventilators in the event of a pandemic? Did you know that the task force accepted a widespread ventilator shortage as inevitable in the event of a respiratory pandemic? 

[Directly from the 2015 task force:](https://www.health.ny.gov/regulations/task_force/reports_publications/docs/ventilator_guidelines_faqs.pdf)

&gt; Q: Can the State stockpile as many ventilators as would be needed in a severe pandemic?
&gt;A: Even if New York State purchases additional ventilators, the demand would quickly outpace supply in a severe pandemic. **No matter how many ventilators are available, in a severe pandemic there will be shortages because so many people will be sick at the same time.** In addition, even with enough ventilators, a sufficient number of trained staff may not be available to operate them, particularly because health care workers will be among the ill.

He’s shocked at the ventilator shortage and passing the buck to the federal government. He was aware of the state’s shortages in 2015 and didn’t do anything to address it. Now he’s screaming at the federal government to hand over the entire nation’s ventilator stockpile. What a “hero.”

The city does have a strong college demographic which sways sites like Reddit, but for the most part, NYC is center right.

201,cuomo,"The trends matter more than the exact number, IMO. If [NYC.gov](https://NYC.gov) is reporting with the same limitations and delays every day, then the overall trend can still be informative. [NYC.gov](https://NYC.gov)'s official data shows that infection rate has declined over the past week (since 3/30.) However, the death rate really has not, and has held roughly steady with a very slight downward trend. I recommend ignoring weekends- there is clear under reporting. These numbers make a lot of sense- cases will decline 1-2 weeks before we see death's decline. However, some statisticians (as noted by Cuomo) predict a sharp drop off rather than gradual if the stay at home order is obeyed. This would of course relieve the burden on hospitals and possibly save more lives just from resource availability. No one can know for sure if that prediction is right (again, as noted by Cuomo,) but here's hoping.

Overall this actually is really great news. Flattening the curve involves avoiding that exponential growth. Even when there is growth, if its MANAGEABLE by the healthcare system that is a game changer for everyone.",1,1586182241

Just last week, I biked past the USNS comfort (on my way to get a physical to be cleared to volunteer as a nurse in NYC HHC) and there were huge groups of people gathered around taking pictures. Cops were there and did NOTHING. Not even a “hey, 6 feet”. Ridiculous. Cuomo, bring in the state police!",1,1586187586
203,cuomo,"Bill de Blasio has long been spoiling for a fight, just not the one now before him and his city. When he became the 109th mayor of New York, on a colorless winter day in 2014, he promised to lead a struggle against “injustice and inequality.” Although he has had some genuine successes, he has failed to turn the city into a Copenhagen-on-the-Hudson. He hasn’t turned it into Caracas, either. New York is pretty much the same global metropolis it was when he took over.

Aware that his progressive ambitions have been frustrated, de Blasio has complained that legions of enemies—conservatives, capitalists, newspaper headline writers—are arrayed against his vision for the city.

However determined these forces have been to undo him, they are not responsible for what New York magazine called, on March 26, “his worst week as mayor.” Worse than the week in 2014 when two police officers were shot and killed, degrading his relationship with the department. Worse than the many weeks in 2016 of overlapping ethics investigations, which threatened to ensnare the mayor and his top aides.

The enemy, this time around, is very small, in contrast to de Blasio, who is not only tall but somehow enlarged by his own ungainliness (he can perform the impressive feat of filling a room without commanding it). In that enemy’s arsenal is a glycoprotein that protrudes from its surface like the quills of a porcupine. In 1965, researchers decided the glycoproteins made the viral particle they were scrutinizing look like a crown. Resorting to Latin as doctors do, they called it a corona.

Trying to lop off glycoproteins is not why de Blasio got into politics. De Blasio has always looked past New York, has never hidden his national ambitions. Six months ago, he was a moderately credible presidential candidate. I went to a de Blasio event in Des Moines, Iowa, and was struck by the adulation directed his way. I was even more struck by how genuinely happy de Blasio seemed. After concluding his stump speech, he stayed for a good half hour, meeting voters, shaking hands. Through it all, he smiled.

Now he is telling people to wash their hands and cough into their elbows. Of course, every politician in the United States is lathering constituents in the same hand-washing, elbow-coughing advice. But de Blasio seems more irritated at having to do so than most.

He has indicated that irritation with the subtlety of a Times Square advertisement. As all New York tabloid readers know, de Blasio trekked daily from Manhattan to Brooklyn to exercise at the same gym he frequented before becoming mayor. De Blasio continued to travel back to Brooklyn right up to the day he ordered all gyms closed. That last gym trip has become the stuff of legend, an act of petulant defiance from which de Blasio’s reputation will probably never recover.

Leadership is never more apparent than when it is missing. De Blasio was slow to recognize the danger, telling New Yorkers to keep to their ordinary routines—as he did his—even after the World Health Organization had declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.

De Blasio has often been spotted walking in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park, near his old house, even as most New Yorkers are confined to their homes and some New Yorkers fight the coronavirus in overcrowded hospitals. You may have heard that there are parks in Manhattan. Gracie Mansion, where de Blasio lives, is located inside one, an esplanade that follows the East River as it opens gloriously to embrace the Bronx and Queens. The same convoy of SUVs that whisks him to Brooklyn could get him to Central Park in five minutes tops.

I imagine that de Blasio knows where Central Park is, more or less. That’s rather beside the point. Throughout the coronavirus crisis, he has evinced no passion for New Yorkers, or New York. When he gave an interview to MSNBC last Sunday, what marked his face was not exhaustion but exasperation.

In fact, he hasn’t given up on the possibility that he can do nothing in this crisis other than attack Trump, just as he did in his days as a presidential contender. “He’s not acting like a commander in chief, because he doesn’t know how,” de Blasio said on MSNBC two weeks ago. “He should get the hell out of the way.” Even so, he has continued to plead with Trump to do everything in his power to help New York, making for an odd combination of bluster and helplessness.

Much has been wanting about Trump’s response to the outbreak. But de Blasio’s fulminations against Trump are clearly meant to divert from his own failures of leadership. De Blasio equivocated on obvious measures like closing schools. He could not even bring himself to close the city’s playgrounds. When these were finally shuttered, it was by decree of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. De Blasio went along with the plan reluctantly—“I respect that,” he said of the decision—like a child being dragged to the dentist by his determined dad. On WYNC on Friday, he said researchers had only discovered “in the last 48 hours” that asymptomatic people can spread the disease. If Trump made the same preposterous claim, there would be howling calls for impeachment, renewed questions about his state of mind. Public-health professionals have known for months how the coronavirus spreads and who can do the spreading. If de Blasio didn't know, the fault is fully his own.

Abandoned by both Trump and de Blasio, New Yorkers have turned to an unlikely savior in Cuomo, who until this new coronavirus came along had proved a confounding member of the Democratic establishment. That is partly a function of lineage: He is a Cuomo, yes, but he is not his father, Mario, whose speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention was so eloquent an articulation of liberalism that it has not been rivaled in more than three decades. Andrew Cuomo has never quite explained what kind of liberal he is, other than the kind who wants power.

Cuomo considered a 2020 presidential run, then thought better of it. This was not a year for the kind of unsexy managerial expertise that tends to reside in a governor’s mansion. The voters wanted fiery rhetoric to match Trump’s. De Blasio, in this limited sense, was up to the task. “Donald Trump must be stopped,” de Blasio said in his announcement video. “I’ve beaten him before, and I will do it again,” the mayor said, leaving others to divine where those victories over the president had come.

The pandemic, however, has already changed the political calculus, and now some people are clamoring for Cuomo to replace Joe Biden, who leads in the delegate count for the Democratic nomination. How that would happen, nobody credible has a clue. And it probably won’t. But every time Cuomo takes to a podium in his windbreaker, such hopes are revived.

What, exactly, has Cuomo done? Maybe, in aggregate, not so much. Then again, the answer really depends on what you mean by done. Cuomo can no more defeat the coronavirus on his own than General Patton could single-handedly beat back the Germans at the Battle of the Bulge. For that matter, no one expects de Blasio to hijack a Columbia University lab and emerge, after a feverish night, with a vaccine. People want decency, honesty, and compassion. They want him to understand that something greater than his gentle 90-minute communion with a stationary bike in Brooklyn hangs in the balance.

Many people are saying (to borrow a phrase) that Aristotle understood politics as well as any human who has ever lived—Nate Silver notwithstanding. A concept central to Aristotle’s political philosophy is phronesis, which he defined as “having the right feelings at the right time on the right occasion towards the right people for the right purpose and in the right manner.”

Politics is about getting it. The only reason Cuomo is being celebrated is because he gets it. He understands what is happening and why, what may happen, what can be done, what must be. Cuomo has the phronesis thing. He feels your pain. De Blasio is phronesis-free. He seems to have the opposite quality, an almost impressive ability to strike the wrong tone—the tone of a liberal warrior before the world changed.

Because New York remained prosperous and safe during most of de Blasio’s generally hapless tenure as mayor, his constituents have forgiven the man his shortcomings, whether these involve ethical lapses or embarrassing displays of national ambition. But of the many luxuries the coronavirus has effaced, one is the tacit acceptance of incompetence. New Yorkers no longer have any patience with rhetoric, nor any taste for purposeless fulmination. De Blasio rails against Trump on cable news and it means nothing, because people are dying in Elmhurst and Flatbush. The people need something, they crave it. Maybe it is the thing Aristotle wrote about, or maybe it is something else entirely. Maybe it is a ventilator; maybe it is hope. Whatever it is, Bill de Blasio is simply unable to give it to them.",1,1586188724

(Real great guy, that Cuomo, no ethical issues there. /s)  
The 'affordable housing' system has always been a racket, both in the sheer inadequacy of units built, and how the income levels / rental rates are set based on Westchester / Nassau county incomes, which are higher than NYC. Can also thank Bill Clinton for agreeing that [public housing needed a cap limit](https://truthout.org/articles/dont-build-the-wall-build-affordable-housing/). (Hmm, wonder who his HUD Secretary was in 1999 when the Faircloth limit was enacted?)

That being said, there are more units available under the NYC Affordable Housing program in recent years once that dictatorially-minded Republican Bloomberg decided to stop buying mayoral elections -- just they're nearly all priced at or above market rate.

213,cuomo,This would hold true if the source of the majority of cases in NYC was Manhattan which is by far the densest borough (spoiler alert: Manhattan is not the worst hit). Queens leads the city in cases and it has a population density equivalent to SF. So much for that tired talking point. The difference is CA and SF have better leadership than NY and NYC do. They took it seriously out there while cuomo and de blasio measured dicks over who would get the credit for every decision,-7,1586540534
214,cuomo,"SF doesn't have a public transportation system like NYC which was most likely a main transmission point, they also don't have nearly the same amount of cab drivers. Not to mention NY has one of the highest travel rates from abroad.  
Then let's move on to the fact that Queens has one of the highest immigrant populations in the country, factor into that everything said above and you can't compare NYC and SF.  
You're totally ignoring the variables of NYC that make it a better target for pandemics than SF which is why I say your logic is flawed and you're missing the point.

The federal government should have passed on the information it had from January and got states prepared.

Like yeah Cuomo should of rub his crystal ball a foreseen this and shut down one of the biggest city in the world, when the federal government, FDA, CDC were giving him no information is as retarded as you.

266,cuomo,"The Covid-19 crisis is especially dire in this New York City borough. Our neighborhoods, many of them in Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s district, are called “the epicenter of the epicenter,” and our hospitals “hot zones.”

Dense neighborhoods with several generations living under the same roof suffered a rapid spread of the disease, producing 38,733 cases as of Sunday, the highest of the five boroughs.

The economy has also been devastated. Tens of thousands are out of work because their jobs can’t be done from home. Before the pandemic, roughly 120,000 residents in the 14th Congressional District—which covers northwest Queens and part of the Bronx—worked in food service, hotels, arts and entertainment, retail or construction. Now, most of them are out of work. That’s over one-third of the district’s working population of 350,000.

Restaurants and hotels had to shut down, but one massive employer has held on to staff and even is hiring tens of thousands more around the country: Amazon.

For the people of Queens, that is a thumb in the eye. We had the chance to let Amazon open a second headquarters here with 25,000 new jobs. Economists debate the multiplier effect it would have had, with some saying there would be five new jobs, many of them in Queens, for every Amazon hire. Even the most skeptical economists put the figure at seven other jobs per 10 Amazon hires. In other words those 25,000 Amazon jobs would have meant at least 42,500 total jobs, and perhaps as many as 125,000. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who backed the deal, put the number at 107,000.

That’s why New York City’s minority residents were overwhelmingly in favor of Amazon. Tenants in the Queensbridge Houses, the largest housing project in the U.S. and the one closest to what would’ve been the new Amazon campus, pushed hard for the opportunities it would bring.

Nonetheless, politicians campaigned against the project, and Amazon pulled out. The loudest opponent was Ms. Ocasio-Cortez.

That’s why I’m challenging AOC in the June 23 Democratic primary. As I campaign in Queens and the Bronx, voters tell me it is dawning on them how much their representative lied to them. The democratic socialist made it sound like $3 billion in tax subsidies for Amazon would be coming out of their pockets.

In truth, New York City and state would have received $27 billion in tax revenue over 10 years instead of $30 billion—a return of 800% on the $3 billion tax break. Once residents understand that subsidies are merely a discount on taxes rather than a cash payment to companies, they feel bamboozled, angry and betrayed by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez.

Imagine how much better off Queens would be in this emergency if we could count on a strong and growing employer like Amazon—still hiring even now—to provide residents with jobs on the way to our recovery.",-3,1587417323

&gt; 
&gt; In a new study conducted by New York state, nearly a quarter of New York City’s population was found to have been sickened by coronavirus and revealed the shocking spread of the killer pandemic, Gov. Cuomo said Thursday.
&gt; 
&gt; Cuomo said an eye-popping 21% of people from the five boroughs who were picked to be tested outside supermarkets and big box stores have contracted the disease at some point.
&gt; 
&gt; The study suggests nearly two million New Yorkers in the city have gotten the feared virus, including a slightly larger number of men than women, Cuomo suggested.
&gt; 
&gt; “What does it mean? They were infected three weeks ago and four weeks ago and five weeks ago or six weeks ago,” Cuomo. said. “They have the virus and they developed the antibodies and they are recovered.”
&gt; 
&gt; The grim numbers, which experts say are comparable to infection rates in hard-hit parts of Europe, will shape the state and city’s plans to reopen at some point from the devastating pandemic.
&gt; 
&gt; “What you do in a place with 21% is very different,” he said. “The facts dictate the action.”
&gt; 
&gt; Statewide, 13.9% of New Yorkers tested positive for the antibodies that are produced when people fight off the virus.
&gt; 
&gt; Long Island had a 16.7% rate. Westchester and Rockland clocked in at 11.7%. Upstate, just 3.9% tested positive in the study, which covered 19 counties and 40 municipalities.
&gt; 
&gt; “That reinforces the idea that the disease was spreading widely before any social distancing went into effect,” Dr. Peter Hotez of Baylor University told CNN. “It’s truly heartbreaking.”
&gt; 
&gt; Even worse, it’s likely that the random study may actually underestimate the share of the population that has been sickened. First responders and frontline health workers were likely not included because they are unlikely to have been out shopping when the random tests were completed, Cuomo said.
&gt; 
&gt; The study also documented the heavy toll that coronavirus has taken on people of color. Blacks and Latinos were more than twice as likely as white New Yorkers to have gotten the killer virus.
&gt; 
&gt; More than 15,000 New Yorkers have been killed by coronavirus. But Cuomo warned Thursday that those numbers only include those who have died in hospitals and nursing homes -- and the real toll is surely even grimmer.
&gt; 
&gt; New Yorkers have died in the past two months a rate much higher than previous years, suggesting that coronavirus is killing far more people than the official figures say.
&gt; 
&gt; “It is not an accurate number of deaths because it does not count at-home deaths,” Cuomo said. “It is not accurate because there have been many other deaths that’s not tested for COVID.”
&gt; 
&gt; Cuomo announced the figures as the state’s daily death toll dipped a bit to 438 Thursday.

313,trump,"It’s also why Italy is changing up their testing criteria and why Japan has been actively dissuading people for testing all but the most severe cases.

I get there’s a lot of paranoia about this virus but, to be honest, it doesn’t really amount to anything. The vast majority of people who experience it will have little to no symptoms (which is why there’s already community spread in USA). And unlike South Korea which is sponsoring the testing and everyone connected (sick or not) to a person who has caught the virus—USA is government has not.

Likewise, the entire USA for the pass few months has been relying on just one testing source—the CDC lab in Atlanta, Georgia. And California was even blocked from purchasing testing kits from South Korea.

But the major two things that work against your suggestion here, isn’t even the bureaucracy and inefficiency of our country and it’s medical system to handle a pandemic (even if it was severe, which it is not)—it’s politics and economics.

The whole reason we haven’t been testing everyone and everything related to it, is because of the prohibitive cost. Likewise, the higher the count goes, the major damage that country’s get dealt—politically, socially, economically and etc. So the USA government is not inclined to test it just let they don’t test for HSV-1, despise 40%-60 of adults in America   Being estimated to have already contracted it.

It sets up undue consequences, repercussions and stigma to know they have a long-life STD that essentially doesn’t even alter their or other people’s lives in a significant manner. So why tank a country’s long term economy, political relationships and societal balance for a short-term fix to hysteria.

Which brings us to the second point. The would reflect poorly on the administration no matter what. Let’s stand with assumption this will go on forever. And people bring up the Spanish flu but there’s also MERS, H1N1, mad cow disease, avian flu and etc. Every one of these “epidemics” has passed on. The virus causing them haven’t disappeared though—just the media attention.

Hell, the medical administration already bundles H1N1 (swine flu) into the flu season. So unless this becomes the next bubonic plague, which extremely unlikely, life will go on after this.

What won’t go on, is the amount of damage done to all the long term trade partners and geopolitical allies. The US has 800+ military bases overseas. The next major world power has 39-ish.

If the USA engages in this pattern of behavior, the image of America as “protector of the free world”, slides very very easily into—self-serving infiltration. Already we had resentment brewing agains American military under the surface, even amongst our long-standing allies—Japan, Germany, South Korea and etc. 

The more US appears in it for itself, the less stable the world is perceived to be. The less stable the world appears to be, the more current political structure of the world is questioned—and the major of that criticism is targeted at those in charge. In the US that means Trump. But around the world, that means America.

You perform abstinence and go to church every Sunday and keep space between you and your dance partner for Jesus and vow celibacy to protect yourself against every single STD known to existence.

Cut the USAID Predict program -- created in response to a prior flu scare that was surveillance program for dangerous animal viruses 

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/health/predict-usaid-viruses.html

Trump's attempts to cut overall CDC budgets have been overruled by COngress (and in current budget he is yet again proposing to cut the budget).  But needed increases to fund program commitments... in 2018 the CDC budget to prevent global disease outbreak was cut by 80% as its funding for the program began to run out. As a result it had to focus on 10 priority countries and scale back in others, including China.

And the CDC *was* working with other countries since the beginning of the outbreak overseas. We were just arrogantly ignoring most of their recommendations and research and deciding to go our own way, like we typically do, and have done across the span of numerous administrations.

There is plenty of blame to go around, but to try to heap it all on Trump and a few budget cuts (cuts that were largely to duplicate programs and positions handled simultaneously by  multiple different agencies) is either naive or intentionally disingenuous.

Most of the cuts were irrelevant to the current situation. And the response we have had so far would have likely been identical under prior administrations. We are not prepared now. We have never been prepared in the past, and we have never taken preparedness for such situations seriously under any political regime. Trump didn't make us *more* prepared, but there little evidence to support that he actually made us *less* prepared either, despite people linking to news stories about unrelated cuts.

Also, it was *Congress* that voted on and passed those budgets, including the cuts. The President makes recommendations for spending and Congress actually passes every appropriation, or cut to appropriations, with legislation.

We've missed many thousands of early diagnoses needlessly, and it will cost thousands of lives.

I note that you have no problem with OP's finger pointing at NYC. I'm guessing it made you happy, until just now when the hypocrisy is pointed out.

The reasons that the federal government is uniquely suited to providing ""stuff"" in an emergency are that (a) it can draw on the resources of an entire nation to help stabilize a region in need, and (b) it can print money and doesn't need to balance the budget as a constitutional matter every year, unlike NY.

**Rhode Island begins door to door checks for New Yorkers fleeing coronavirus**

WESTERLY, RI — The Rhode Island National Guard started going door to door on Saturday in coastal areas to inform any [New Yorkers who may have come to the state](https://nypost.com/2020/03/28/rhode-island-sending-cops-national-guard-to-find-new-yorkers-seeking-coronavirus-refuge/) that they must self-quarantine for 14 days while Gov. Gina Raimondo expanded the mandatory self-quarantine to anyone visiting the state.

Raimondo also ordered residents to stay at home, with exceptions for getting food, medicines or going to the doctor, and ordered nonessential retail businesses to close Monday until April 13 to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. She also directed realtors and hotel operators to include new requirements that any out-of-state residents must quarantine for 14 days in their purchase agreements.

State Police set up a checkpoint on I-95 in Hope Valley on Friday where drivers with New York license plates must stop and provide contact information and were told to self-quarantine for two weeks, WPRI.com reported.

If New Yorkers don’t comply, they face fines and jail time, Raimondo said, adding that that’s not the goal.
“I want to be crystal clear about this: If you’re coming to Rhode Island from New York you are ordered into quarantine. The reason for that is because more than half of the cases of coronavirus in America are in New York,” Raimondo said, adding that it’s not meant to be discriminatory.

“I want to be crystal clear about this: If you’re coming to Rhode Island from New York you are ordered into quarantine. The reason for that is because more than half of the cases of coronavirus in America are in New York,” Raimondo said, adding that it’s not meant to be discriminatory.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo called the order “reactionary” and unconstitutional, saying he’d sue Rhode Island if the policy isn’t rescinded but believed they could “work it out.”

“I understand the goal … but there’s a point of absurdity, and I think what Rhode Island did is at that point of absurdity,” said Cuomo, a Democrat. “We have to keep the ideas and the policies we implement positive rather than reactionary and emotional.”

President Donald Trump said Saturday that he had spoken with some governors and was considering some type of a quarantine to prevent people in New York and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut from traveling. Trump Late Saturday, though, he tweeted that a travel advisory should be administered and not a quarantine.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbot on Thursday joined other states in imposing quarantines on air travelers from the New York area, including New Jersey and Connecticut, and New Orleans, two places where COVID-19 outbreak is more severe. The Republican said travelers who don’t comply with the 14-day quarantine risk jail time, adding that state troopers would conduct visits to make sure people were staying put.
In Rhode Island, which reported its first two deaths from COVID-19 on Saturday, a team of a Westerly police officer and a Guard member were visiting stately and modest coastal homes in the Westerly neighborhood of Watch Hill collecting contact information from New Yorkers and telling them to self-quarantine. They expected to go to about 1,000 homes over a few days.

“This is more of an education tool to make people aware and comply with what we are asking them to do,” said Westerly, Rhode Island, police chief Shawn Lacey. “We are certainly hope it doesn’t get to enforcement action that has to happen.”

Reha Kocatas, a New Yorker who arrived March 22 from the Bahamas to his Rhode Island home, said his wife and two children were visited by a police officer and a national guardsmen. Already under a 14-day quarantine per a state order because he had arrived from outside the 50 states and the District of Columbia, Kocatas said he volunteered information to the authorities including the number of people in the home, when they entered Rhode Island and his and his wife’s date of birth.
But he questioned why it was necessary to send a police officer to his door.

“It seemed like a pretty large waste of resources for something that could have been volunteered through an online form pretty quickly,” he said.

“If New Yorkers are such high risk individuals, why are we putting first responders in front of these individuals is a little questionable since there is no action item at the end of the day,” he continued. “They weren’t going to remove us. It seemed like bureaucratic grandstanding. The local community that happens to be here believes that it’s a waste of precious resources when time is the essence in preparing for other things.”

Ramaindo said only an estimated 50% of Rhode Islanders are complying with social distancing, with",1,1585499463
468,trump,"&gt;Cuomo is right about the absurdity aspect.

More so because stopping every car / going to every house is likely to infect a cop. Then that cop is going to infect everyone he stops / visits. This is a net negative idea. 

But seemingly, Americans love a strong man and doing pointless shit that makes the problem worse has absolutely been a success for Trump, so here we are.

&gt; And then you have to consider that fact the reason NY's case count is so high is because the state has been testing at a far higher rate than any other state,

That's not certain as best I can tell. Hospital admissions are mostly immune from a lack of testing, more so if you count flu admission in your number. NYS hospital admission numbers are high. What's interesting is no one seems to be noticing so are GA and LA.",1,1585509290

Also, the Persians/Iranians are great negotiators and just killed (literally?) us.

&gt; Look, having nuclear — my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, okay, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart — you know, if you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, okay, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I'm one of the smartest people anywhere in the world — it’s true! — but when you're a conservative Republican they try — oh, do they do a number — that’s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune — you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little disadvantaged — but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me — it would have been so easy, and it’s not as important as these lives are (nuclear is powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what's going to happen and he was right — who would have thought?), but when you look at what's going on with the four prisoners — now it used to be three, now it’s four — but when it was three and even now, I would have said it's all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don't, they haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about another 150 years — but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us.

Now you should be reflecting on why you see SO MUCH ANTI-BIDEN propaganda while in Trump's bizarre mental state he's somehow (?) managed to bungle a response to a pandemic by not providing testing or ventilators. Biden checked notes on the pandemic, whereas Trump went straight into banning testing to obscure how many cases there are because that might make him look bad. Yet I'm watching Sanders reddits whip themselves up into justifying not voting for Biden because he's old, whereas Trump is running literal concentration camps on U.S. soil and believes climate change is not happening, and acting from his own mental acuity didn't really know how to respond to a global pandemic.

""I'll vote for Biden but damn I don't like him"" -- firstly, people who say that are probably lying, when your attachment to whoever wins is that anemic no one's going to force you. Secondly, I _want_ Biden to win more than I feel vaguely obligated to support him because some progressives on social media say to. I'm pretty clear about why and I think my concerns about the mental acuity of the KKK-endorsed most corrupt president in U.S. history are a lot more serious than Biden \*checks notes\* checking notes on his pandemic response.",1,1585755792

I'm sorry voting for Biden isn't going to be as fun as voting for Sanders would be, or as much fun as voting for Obama was. It's just that I'm not voting for Biden because it's fun.

The city does have a strong college demographic which sways sites like Reddit, but for the most part, NYC is center right.

525,trump,"Bill de Blasio has long been spoiling for a fight, just not the one now before him and his city. When he became the 109th mayor of New York, on a colorless winter day in 2014, he promised to lead a struggle against “injustice and inequality.” Although he has had some genuine successes, he has failed to turn the city into a Copenhagen-on-the-Hudson. He hasn’t turned it into Caracas, either. New York is pretty much the same global metropolis it was when he took over.

Aware that his progressive ambitions have been frustrated, de Blasio has complained that legions of enemies—conservatives, capitalists, newspaper headline writers—are arrayed against his vision for the city.

However determined these forces have been to undo him, they are not responsible for what New York magazine called, on March 26, “his worst week as mayor.” Worse than the week in 2014 when two police officers were shot and killed, degrading his relationship with the department. Worse than the many weeks in 2016 of overlapping ethics investigations, which threatened to ensnare the mayor and his top aides.

The enemy, this time around, is very small, in contrast to de Blasio, who is not only tall but somehow enlarged by his own ungainliness (he can perform the impressive feat of filling a room without commanding it). In that enemy’s arsenal is a glycoprotein that protrudes from its surface like the quills of a porcupine. In 1965, researchers decided the glycoproteins made the viral particle they were scrutinizing look like a crown. Resorting to Latin as doctors do, they called it a corona.

Trying to lop off glycoproteins is not why de Blasio got into politics. De Blasio has always looked past New York, has never hidden his national ambitions. Six months ago, he was a moderately credible presidential candidate. I went to a de Blasio event in Des Moines, Iowa, and was struck by the adulation directed his way. I was even more struck by how genuinely happy de Blasio seemed. After concluding his stump speech, he stayed for a good half hour, meeting voters, shaking hands. Through it all, he smiled.

Now he is telling people to wash their hands and cough into their elbows. Of course, every politician in the United States is lathering constituents in the same hand-washing, elbow-coughing advice. But de Blasio seems more irritated at having to do so than most.

He has indicated that irritation with the subtlety of a Times Square advertisement. As all New York tabloid readers know, de Blasio trekked daily from Manhattan to Brooklyn to exercise at the same gym he frequented before becoming mayor. De Blasio continued to travel back to Brooklyn right up to the day he ordered all gyms closed. That last gym trip has become the stuff of legend, an act of petulant defiance from which de Blasio’s reputation will probably never recover.

Leadership is never more apparent than when it is missing. De Blasio was slow to recognize the danger, telling New Yorkers to keep to their ordinary routines—as he did his—even after the World Health Organization had declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.

De Blasio has often been spotted walking in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park, near his old house, even as most New Yorkers are confined to their homes and some New Yorkers fight the coronavirus in overcrowded hospitals. You may have heard that there are parks in Manhattan. Gracie Mansion, where de Blasio lives, is located inside one, an esplanade that follows the East River as it opens gloriously to embrace the Bronx and Queens. The same convoy of SUVs that whisks him to Brooklyn could get him to Central Park in five minutes tops.

I imagine that de Blasio knows where Central Park is, more or less. That’s rather beside the point. Throughout the coronavirus crisis, he has evinced no passion for New Yorkers, or New York. When he gave an interview to MSNBC last Sunday, what marked his face was not exhaustion but exasperation.

In fact, he hasn’t given up on the possibility that he can do nothing in this crisis other than attack Trump, just as he did in his days as a presidential contender. “He’s not acting like a commander in chief, because he doesn’t know how,” de Blasio said on MSNBC two weeks ago. “He should get the hell out of the way.” Even so, he has continued to plead with Trump to do everything in his power to help New York, making for an odd combination of bluster and helplessness.

Much has been wanting about Trump’s response to the outbreak. But de Blasio’s fulminations against Trump are clearly meant to divert from his own failures of leadership. De Blasio equivocated on obvious measures like closing schools. He could not even bring himself to close the city’s playgrounds. When these were finally shuttered, it was by decree of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. De Blasio went along with the plan reluctantly—“I respect that,” he said of the decision—like a child being dragged to the dentist by his determined dad. On WYNC on Friday, he said researchers had only discovered “in the last 48 hours” that asymptomatic people can spread the disease. If Trump made the same preposterous claim, there would be howling calls for impeachment, renewed questions about his state of mind. Public-health professionals have known for months how the coronavirus spreads and who can do the spreading. If de Blasio didn't know, the fault is fully his own.

Abandoned by both Trump and de Blasio, New Yorkers have turned to an unlikely savior in Cuomo, who until this new coronavirus came along had proved a confounding member of the Democratic establishment. That is partly a function of lineage: He is a Cuomo, yes, but he is not his father, Mario, whose speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention was so eloquent an articulation of liberalism that it has not been rivaled in more than three decades. Andrew Cuomo has never quite explained what kind of liberal he is, other than the kind who wants power.

Cuomo considered a 2020 presidential run, then thought better of it. This was not a year for the kind of unsexy managerial expertise that tends to reside in a governor’s mansion. The voters wanted fiery rhetoric to match Trump’s. De Blasio, in this limited sense, was up to the task. “Donald Trump must be stopped,” de Blasio said in his announcement video. “I’ve beaten him before, and I will do it again,” the mayor said, leaving others to divine where those victories over the president had come.

The pandemic, however, has already changed the political calculus, and now some people are clamoring for Cuomo to replace Joe Biden, who leads in the delegate count for the Democratic nomination. How that would happen, nobody credible has a clue. And it probably won’t. But every time Cuomo takes to a podium in his windbreaker, such hopes are revived.

What, exactly, has Cuomo done? Maybe, in aggregate, not so much. Then again, the answer really depends on what you mean by done. Cuomo can no more defeat the coronavirus on his own than General Patton could single-handedly beat back the Germans at the Battle of the Bulge. For that matter, no one expects de Blasio to hijack a Columbia University lab and emerge, after a feverish night, with a vaccine. People want decency, honesty, and compassion. They want him to understand that something greater than his gentle 90-minute communion with a stationary bike in Brooklyn hangs in the balance.

Many people are saying (to borrow a phrase) that Aristotle understood politics as well as any human who has ever lived—Nate Silver notwithstanding. A concept central to Aristotle’s political philosophy is phronesis, which he defined as “having the right feelings at the right time on the right occasion towards the right people for the right purpose and in the right manner.”

Politics is about getting it. The only reason Cuomo is being celebrated is because he gets it. He understands what is happening and why, what may happen, what can be done, what must be. Cuomo has the phronesis thing. He feels your pain. De Blasio is phronesis-free. He seems to have the opposite quality, an almost impressive ability to strike the wrong tone—the tone of a liberal warrior before the world changed.

Because New York remained prosperous and safe during most of de Blasio’s generally hapless tenure as mayor, his constituents have forgiven the man his shortcomings, whether these involve ethical lapses or embarrassing displays of national ambition. But of the many luxuries the coronavirus has effaced, one is the tacit acceptance of incompetence. New Yorkers no longer have any patience with rhetoric, nor any taste for purposeless fulmination. De Blasio rails against Trump on cable news and it means nothing, because people are dying in Elmhurst and Flatbush. The people need something, they crave it. Maybe it is the thing Aristotle wrote about, or maybe it is something else entirely. Maybe it is a ventilator; maybe it is hope. Whatever it is, Bill de Blasio is simply unable to give it to them.",1,1586188724

This is simply false. He blocked non-US nationals from entering the US from China, but allowed a ton of e exceptions.

&gt;Trump barred non-U.S. citizens from traveling from China, but there were 11 exceptions, and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan were not included. U.S. citizens and permanent residents could still travel from China but were subject to screening and possible 14-day quarantine. Some flights were immediately suspended, but others continued for weeks, at the discretion of the airlines.

I saw people call for a national lockdown and here in Australia (I am a tourist in this sub, I have friends in NYC) the PM is able to do that, and states get to extend it to a greater degree if they would like (and many have). Nobody can reopen past those measures our PM made, though. 

Is it the case that Trump has that sort of nationwide power *in emergency situations only*, to make emergency orders to close down states (i.e. he can't make an 'emergency order' to reopen everything bc it doesn't respond to the emergency)? Or is he right in saying he didn't have the power to shut anyone down in the first place? 

I read someone criticise Dems for asking Trump to close every state down (total control) and then arguing with him when he claims he has that control.

It's only because the federal government is ignoring it that states have it. 

However a government shutdown is a weird scenario.  It's not ""law"" that a state government has to be open. That said, it wouldn't have been an official ""law"" if Trump signed an executive order to shut down all the states either (at least I don't think so, I don't know what power a State of Emergency grants Executive Orders). 

Ultimately I'm not sure most of us know what's legal.  The way I understand it is that States should have the right to be _more_ strict than the federal government says (by enforcing shut down longer), but they wouldn't be able to stay open if there was an Executive Order to close.

667,trump,"This statement is so full of half truths, mixed facts and downright lies.

&gt;Restaurants and hotels had to shut down, but one massive employer has held on to staff and even is hiring tens of thousands more around the country: Amazon.

Amazon's increased hiring is in warehouse and delivery jobs. Coincidentally, the same jobs that were NOT coming with HQ2. Coincidentally, the same jobs that came anyway, since they were needed. And coincidentally, the same jobs that people working them right now are complaining of Amazon's mistreatment and being unsafe. 

Then, let's keep going.

&gt;Economists debate the multiplier effect it would have had, with some saying there would be five new jobs, many of them in Queens, for every Amazon hire. Even the most skeptical economists put the figure at seven other jobs per 10 Amazon hires. In other words those 25,000 Amazon jobs would have meant at least 42,500 total jobs, and perhaps as many as 125,000. 

Literally one paragraph earlier:

&gt;Before the pandemic, roughly 120,000 residents in the 14th Congressional District—which covers northwest Queens and part of the Bronx—worked in food service, hotels, arts and entertainment, retail or construction. Now, most of them are out of work.

Where do you think these ancillary jobs are located? The same industries you just decried as being closed during a pandemic. Had Amazon graced us with their jobs (which they did in Manhattan, but you know, residents of NY 14 can't leave NY 14. We are stuck here like flies on flypaper), all those ancillary jobs would be out of work just the same. What, you think that somehow, Amazon would magically keep construction going through this, same with entertainment, food industry, hotels, arts and entertainment and retail? All these businesses are closed elsewhere in the city or are closing, but Amazon would have, through magic, I assume, keep them open and keep those people working.


&gt;The democratic socialist made it sound like $3 billion in tax subsidies for Amazon would be coming out of their pockets.

That's precisely where it would have been coming from. If the state has taxes that would extract 30 billion but only extracts 27 billion, that 3 billion dollars is coming straight from our pockets. The state could barely balance the budget before this COVID pandemic. Having to cut an additional 3 billion dollars over the next 10 years would have led to even more cuts in various spending.

&gt;In truth, New York City and state would have received $27 billion in tax revenue over 10 years instead of $30 billion—a return of 800% on the $3 billion tax break. 

If it were all about tax incentives, they would have parked that HQ 2 out in Maryland that offered 8 billion in incentives, or Newark, NJ for which NJ offered 7 billion in incentives. But nope, what they ended up doing is planting it in Arlington, VA, with their measly 500 mil in tax incentives and close proximity to the Pentagon and then promptly got fucked by Trump when they didn't get the DOD contract they really wanted. Instead of giving them 3 billion dollars over 10 years, now we are giving them 0 tax incentives and what's Amazon doing? Bringing in thousands of jobs to NYC, making billion dollar realestate deals. Turns out that NYC is where the talent is. Maybe we don't need to sweeten a pot of fucking honey for one of the biggest companies in America. 

&gt;Imagine how much better off Queens would be in this emergency if we could count on a strong and growing employer like Amazon—still hiring even now—to provide residents with jobs on the way to our recovery.

And again, HQ2 would not have been a warehouse nor would they be hiring delivery drivers, where the largest hiring expansion has been.

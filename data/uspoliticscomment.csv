&gt;“Well, I think the 3.4% is really a false number,” the President told the conservative cable network’s Sean Hannity. “Now, this is just my hunch, and, but based on a lot of conversation with a lot of people who do this, because a lot of people will have this and it’s very mild. They’ll get better very rapidly. They don’t even see a doctor. They don’t even call a doctor. You never hear about those people, so you can’t put them down in the category of the overall population in terms of this corona flu, and, or virus, so you just can’t do that,” Trump said, clearly trying to minimize the danger and the numbers of people infected.

&gt;“So we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that just get better, by, you know, sitting around and even going to work – some of ’em go to work – but they get better,”

it's funny how the media has been having a field day twisting his words, yet today there are articles reporting exactly what he was saying:

[The U.S. has the world's highest coronavirus death rate at more than 5% - a number that reflects the country's lack of testing](https://www.aol.com/article/news/2020/03/06/the-us-has-the-worlds-highest-coronavirus-death-rate-at-more-than-5-a-number-that-reflects-the-countrys-lack-of-testing/23941708/?a_dgi=aolshare_twitter&amp;guccounter=1)

&gt;So the U.S. has not tested or diagnosed many patients with mild cases.

&gt;""There's another whole cohort that is either asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic,"" Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a February 6 briefing. **""We're going to see a diminution in the overall death rate.""**

south korea has been testing at a higher rate than most

&gt;South Korea, by contrast, has implemented free coronavirus-testing drive-thrus and tested more than 136,000 people. **The country's death rate is currently just 0.5%** — 35 deaths out of a total of 6,088 reported infections.

so when more people are tested the death rate is much much lower.. that's exactly what he said",1,1583541219

1. He is 79 meaning he is in the highest risk category and has a significant bias toward wanting to protect that category even at the risk of economic collapse, since he will likely not live to see the results of such a collapse anyway but does not want to die of disease. 
2. He got his position in 1984, meaning, the narrative is that  nobody better has been found in all of America to run NIAID since Return of the Jedi came out in movie theaters, which seems very difficult to believe. 
3. He was in charge of NIAID during at least eight times when they, the CDC, or both released predictions about serious illness threats to the US population, and all eight times these predictions were wrong. (Hanta, SARS, Swine flu, Bird flu, Mad cow disease, West Nile, Ebola, Zika)
4. In spite of the CDC determining coronavirus lives 3 days on plastic surfaces, and Fauci claiming that we should discard cereal boxes and keep only the inner bag because of concerns the virus may be there, the USPS continues to add 700 million items of junk mail each day, which indicates that even the USPS discounts Fauci's advice since most junk mail incorporates cardboard or plastic or both and travels a minimal distance and time. (E.g. plastic clear envelope windows, plastic tape, laminated cards, bags containing t shirts or greeting cards, foil lined wraps, etc.)
5. At a time when the mortality rate in China was at 0.0058%, and in the US was 0.002%, and the rate in China had peaked, but the rate in the US had not, he claimed that the US should expect 100,000 - 240,000 deaths, which is 0.03%-0.07%, ten times higher than in China, without listing a reason why it would be so much worse.",1,1585968480

&gt;President Trump

&gt;on Friday described the decision on when and how to reopen the country as the most difficult one he’s had to make in his life, underscoring the careful line he is walking between concerns about the economy and public health during the coronavirus outbreak.

&gt;“I don’t know that I’ve had a bigger decision. But I’m going to surround myself with the greatest minds. Not only the greatest minds, but the greatest minds in numerous different businesses, including the business of politics and reason,” Trump told reporters at a White House press briefing.

&gt;“And we’re going to make a decision, and hopefully it’s going to be the right decision,” he continued. “I will say this. I want to get it open as soon as we can.”

&gt;Asked what metrics he would use to come to a final conclusion, he pointed at his head, making clear he felt the burden will rest on his shoulders.

&gt;Trump has appeared eager to relax social distancing guidelines recommended by the White House coronavirus task force in order to get Americans back to work, and some officials have suggested in recent days that businesses could prepare to reopen in May. 

&gt;But public health experts have warned about the risk of reopening the country too early, which could set up a nightmare scenario where COVID-19 again surges in communities and overwhelms hospitals.

&gt;“This idea that on May 1 we can just turn the switch, this will not be good from a public health perspective or for our economy,” said Anand Parekh, chief medical adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center. 

&gt;“Not only are you risking a second wave, but a further economic closure,” continued Parekh, who served as Health and Human Services deputy assistant secretary for health between 2008 and 2015. “I think it’s really important to get this right the first time as opposed to opening up too early.” 

&gt;One of the key hurdles to safely reopening the country, according to health experts, is a lack of widely available testing that would help officials quickly determine the source of potential outbreaks.

&gt;But Trump has shrugged off that concern the past two days, saying at briefings he thinks mass testing would be a benefit, but not a necessity. He argued Friday that parts of the farm belt, for example, could get back to work sooner than the rest of the country because it is less densely populated.

&gt;“You don’t have to test every person in the state of Iowa, as an example. You don’t have to test every single person to say ‘let’s open up and let’s get the tractors moving,’” Trump said. “Now with that being said, if there's a little hot corner some place, we’ll be testing.”

&gt;There were more than 486,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. as of Friday afternoon and more than 18,000 people in the U.S. have died of the virus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

&gt;Those figures have been held down largely by statewide stay-at-home orders and federal guidelines that urge Americans to avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people. Still, the federal advisory is set to expire after April 30 and some top Trump officials have already suggested that parts of the economy could reopen shortly thereafter.

&gt;Even if Trump decides to relax the guidelines, the decision to reduce restrictions like stay-at-home orders and business closures would ultimately fall to states that implemented them.

&gt;U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams on Friday pumped the brakes on the possibility that wide swaths of America would reopen at the beginning of May, telling Fox News in an interview that only places that have seen low levels of COVID-19 and have implemented sufficient surveillance techniques to detect and contain further outbreaks would be able to consider opening up by then. 

&gt;“There are places around the country that have seen consistently low levels and as we ramp up testing and can feel more confident that these places actually can do surveillance and can do public health follow-up, some places will be able to think about opening on May 1,” Adams said Friday morning. 

&gt;“Most of the country will not, to be honest with you, but some will. That’s how we’ll reopen the country: place by place, bit by bit, based on the data,” he added.

&gt;Adams’s remarks came a day after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin

&gt;said he believed companies could reopen in May so long as Trump “feels comfortable with the medical issues,” while White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow

&gt;expressed hope the country could begin reopening on a rolling basis in four to eight weeks.

&gt;Some outside advisers have pushed Trump to reopen parts of the country that have not seen significant spread of the virus by May 1, warning of severe economic depression otherwise. 

&gt;To map out a potential reopening, Trump said he will unveil members of a new group Tuesday that he dubbed the “Opening Our Country Council.” The cohort is expected to include administration officials, business leaders and political figures from around the country.

&gt;The coronavirus pandemic has crippled the U.S. economy in recent weeks. Stringent social distancing guidelines have shuttered businesses across the country and millions of Americans have applied for unemployment benefits. Forecasters warn unemployment could hit 20 percent in the coming weeks as the country works to get the virus under control.

&gt;But the strength of the economy has been at the center of Trump’s reelection argument, and he has been fixated on certain financial markers even amid the pandemic.

&gt;He referenced a stock market rally this week during Friday’s briefing, citing it as evidence that businesses had “pent-up demand” and would bounce back upon the easing of restrictions. And when asked why his administration wasn’t better prepared to prevent coronavirus from ravaging at-risk minority communities, he pivoted to talking about low unemployment numbers for African Americans during his administration.

&gt;Trump has repeatedly insisted that he will listen to recommendations from top health officials like Anthony Fauci

&gt;and Deborah Birx when making a decision on when and how to relax the guidelines. But the president has been careful not to commit to taking their advice, saying he will consider a variety of opinions and ultimately reach a decision on his own. 

&gt;“I listen to them about everything. I think they are actually surprised. I have great respect for these people, all of them, and others that are working for us,” Trump told reporters Friday when asked whether he would heed their advice if they recommended against reopening the country in early May. 

&gt;“I will certainly listen,” Trump continued later. “I understand the other side of the argument very well.""",1,1586590039

ABC published an article citing two anonymous sources at the White House claiming they saw an intelligence report on the non-existent virus in November.

**ABC published a correction the following day:**

&gt;Wednesday evening following the publication of this report, the Defense Department provided a statement from Col. R. Shane Day, Director of the NCMI.

&gt;""As a matter of practice the National Center for Medical Intelligence does not comment publicly on specific intelligence matters. However, in the interest of transparency during this current public health crisis, we can confirm that media reporting about the existence/release of a National Center for Medical Intelligence Coronavirus-related product/assessment in November of 2019 is not correct.

This is not true. It is another Trump conspiracy theory.

Possible motive? President Trump has refused to use a wartime law to require major manufacturers to make vital equipment to combat the new coronavirus, reportedly after corporations successfully lobbied his top adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

More on his clubs: Thus far, the Trump Organization, run by the president’s adult sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr., have closed properties in Doral, Florida, Las Vegas, Ireland, Scotland, Bedminster, New Jersey, and Palm Beach, Florida, the home of Mar-a-Lago. **According to the Post, those hotels and clubs represent six of Trump’s top revenue-producing businesses, bringing in about a collective $174 million per year, or $478,000 per day.**

Cuomo said: “The president said it's a war ... then act like it,” Cuomo said, raising his voice during a morning news conference at the Javits Center in Manhattan. “They’re doing the supplies? Here’s my question: Where are they?” If more ventilators aren’t sent within weeks, Cuomo told the feds, “You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die.” [https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2020/03/24/cuomo-to-trump-administration-you-pick-the-26k-people-who-are-going-to-die-1268833](https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2020/03/24/cuomo-to-trump-administration-you-pick-the-26k-people-who-are-going-to-die-1268833)

26,cuomo,"&gt;A 2015 state report said that in the case of a ""severe"" pandemic, the  state would be short about 16,000 ventilators during peak week. But the  report did not recommend buying 16,000 ventilators, and did not  indicate whether the state was at a fiscal position to purchase them.  
&gt;  
&gt;The state did not plan to increase its stockpile because it  anticipated that in the event of a severe crisis, there would be  shortage of trained staff to operate them and demand would outweigh any  emergency stockpile. The report said the state had to balance the likely  ventilator shortage with the need for adequate funding for current and  ongoing health care expenses.  
&gt;  
&gt;The report issued guidelines on ventilator allocation if there  weren’t enough for everyone and suggested that hospitals designate a  triage officer or committee. It explored a lottery system, but did not  recommend it as the primary option. Cuomo did not establish one.",2,1585155135

Setting the bar really low right out of the gates, huh? 

&gt;The only sociopaths in the room are the members of the press that keep asking these questions with framing like ""How often do you beat your wife?"" 

Cool. Thanks for letting us all know you live in a delusional reality where the things you make up in your head define your reality. 

&gt;Trump, at one point, had a reporter misquote him and he had her read the entire quote and it was clear she took it out of context.

No, you mean he corrected himself when his own words were reflected back to him. Just like he and his supporters always have to, because he's essentially an unintelligent half-wit who is on the verge of dementia. 

&gt;There's plenty of actually issues to nail Trump with, but the reporters continue to try and build on narratives and act like activists rather than journalists.

They are doing their job as journalists. Nothing about asking questions is activism except to dictators and authoritarians. 

&gt;None of them really drilled down on how we're going to pay for all the stimulus

With taxes and debt, as is obvious. Funny how you don't seem to care about the rest of how we're paying for things, like trillion dollar Republican tax cuts for the wealthy. 

&gt;and no one is talking about how he's edging closer to how he might invade Iran while things are looking shaky for the regime.

No one is talking about it because there is a global pandemic that has everyone's focus right now. 

&gt;It's non-stop trying to drive a wedge between Trump and Cuomo, Trump and Dr. Falci, Trump and Newsome-

No one is trying to drive anything. Reporting on the news and on Trump's utter incompetence isn't driving a wedge. 

&gt;They look and continue to look like they are only there to attack Trump.

Yes. Because he is inept, incompetent, lazy, and uncaring. He had months where he could have gotten a headstart on this pandemic and he did nothing but put taxpayer into his pocket while playing golf at his own properties. 

&gt;Trump is now more trusted than the media

What a joke. 

&gt;That's not because Trump is trustworthy, but because the media's behavior is so transparent and awful, they continue to double down on this nonsense.

32,cuomo,"Let me guess: the novel Coronavirus may be an unfortunate natural mutation, but evil China took advantage of it to crush the US by refusing to disclose its existence in Wuhan for the month of December 2019 because they knew that if Trump had known of it in early December he would have acted more quickly that Cuomo and Newsom put together to contain it.

The only thing which would have been different if Trump had known about this a month earlier is that he would have banned travel from China to the US a few weeks earlier than he did. Other that that, he would have had a few more weeks bloviating about how it's just a new kind of flu, gone by April, and calling it a pandemic is a Democratic hoax.",1,1585774254

36,cuomo,"Where are your “leadership” skills Mr Trump ?

&gt;#New York Governor Andrew Cuomo described how ventilators went from $25,000 to $45,000 “because we bid $25,000. California says, ‘I’ll give you $30,000’ and Illinois says, ‘I’ll give you $35,000’ and Florida says ‘I’ll give you $40,000. And then, FEMA [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] gets involved and FEMA starts bidding! And now FEMA is bidding on top of the 50! So FEMA is driving up the price. What sense does this make? We’re literally bidding up the prices ourselves.”",1,1586273081

Soon it will be Come on Cuomo",1,1586527214
39,cuomo,"State governments operate under the Federal government, but as long as they largely follow federal laws, they're given a lot more autonomy for how to handle laws in their states. This is why you can buy liquor in Costco in California but not Montana: different laws and different political scenes.

The federal government continues to have mixed messaging with the Center for Disease Control pushing for more and more aggressive measures to curb the spread of the virus, while the president has both delayed action and mishandled the distribution of medical supplies. Normally, the federal government would distribute supplies according to what is most appropriate or equitable in a given crisis. Trump is having individual state governments basically bid against one another for the medical supplies in the Federal stash. This makes the supplies more expensive for the state governments, and brings more profits to the companies who make those supplies.

When you see that some people are handling this better than others, you are seeing some governors, like Gavin Newsom and Andrew Cuomo, taking scientists seriously, while others, like DeSantis, ignoring the research. Each state is kind of operating on its own with such little leadership at the federal level.

An extreme conservative minority is protesting the stay-at-home order because they are concerned, among other things, about civil liberties being restricted and key agricultural goods being restricted in specific states.

As to why so many Americans are conservative, I'd rather not drive down the rabbit hole of how our representative system works, the structural problems with the electoral college, or our corporatized media that tends to either fit into a strictly conservative or neoliberal box. There are a lot of factors in play when it comes to whose voices get represented and amplified as opposed to others. I teach government at the high school level, and could easily go on and on, but I hope this helped a bit.",1,1587271412

41,cuomo,"Governor Cuomo - The Feds need to tell us what to do and supply us with 40,000 ventilators and hospitals and 120,000 beds.  They should do everything centrally so we do not have states bidding against each other.

CNN-Fredo: Yeah!

Also, Governors - The Feds can't tell us what to do.

Also, You and CNN-Fredo: Yeah!",1,1587397002
42,cuomo,"I know it’s complicated to follow for you I’ll try my best to simplify but it’s hard to go much further. Also I’m just breaking down what you said, not addressing each thing specifically since you decided to be as vague as possible:

Cuomo: We have this and we need that as well fro m the national stockpile. It would be great if we could get some direction from the feds since they can assess as a central source national needs and help coordinate.

Also governors: Yes we agree and while you have a function of supporting states in national emergencies and providing guidance its just that. It doesn’t give you free reign to dictate everything to do because although states rights to self governorship may be inconvenient for you sometimes, sorry but constitution?
PS some of our trump worshiper citizens scream this states rights thing all the time then funny enough fall silent if it is viewed as lib in the current moment 😒😂",1,1587399714
43,cuomo,"Cuomo is right about the emergency response. That's what FEMA is specifically for. That's what the White House global pandemic security team was set up by Obama to coordinate. So Yeah!

Of course, John Bolton didn't consider a global pandemic a national security threat, so he disbanded that team in 2018. [OOPS!](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-fire-pandemic-team/)

Cuomo's also right that State Governors have a level of autonomy that the president can't just willy-nilly claim control over. So Yeah!

The federal government has certain responsibilities, as do the states. There's a difference. You'd think the fucking IMPOTUS would know this, instead of claiming sweeping Constitutional privileges that don't exist.

If Trump actually knew about these things, or bothered to listen to any of the *myriad* experts he has access to, he'd know which was which.

But he doesn't listen, he doesn't read, he doesn't know nearly as much as he thinks he does, and is [nowhere *near* as smart as he thinks he is](https://www.truthorfiction.com/trump-was-the-dumbest-gddamn-student/)--regardless of how many of his uncles attended MIT--and his whole presidency is about how much money he can grift before his time is up.

44,cuomo,"You can be asymptomatic and take a sudden turn, yeah.

I see these Karens out there, demanding the business open up so they can get a haircut, or the Biffs demanding their golf. Cuomo said they weren't going to throw anyone in jail for not wearing a mask. But he should. That person is threatening everyone around them.

The handling of the Cornovirus is already off to a terrible start, infrastructure is crumbling, retired people have had to go back to work to afford cost of living (""The lowest unemployment EVER!""), individuals and families continue to struggle with medical costs, the tax cuts failed and further increased the deficit, failed trade war that have put Americans out of business, disregard and sabotage of relationships with longstanding allies, encouraging/welcoming foreign interference in democratic elections, etc., etc., etc.

Additionally, we can actually see you change from your initial sarcastic reply to cheerleading for Trump. That's quite an achievement to pull off in a digital medium.

&gt;IV. ENSURE HEALTH CARE IS A RIGHT FOR ALL, NOT A PRIVILEGE FOR JUST A FEW

* **Expanding access to contraception and protect the constitutional right to an abortion.** The Affordable Care Act made historic progress by ensuring access to free preventive care, including contraception. The Biden Plan will build on that progress. Vice President Biden supports repealing the Hyde Amendment because health care is a right that should not be dependent on one’s zip code or income. And, the public option will cover contraception and a woman’s constitutional right to choose. In addition, the Biden Plan will:

* **Reverse the Trump Administration and states’ all-out assault on women’s right to choose.** As president, Biden will work to codify Roe v. Wade, and his Justice Department will do everything in its power to stop the rash of state laws that so blatantly violate the constitutional right to an abortion, such as so-called TRAP laws, parental notification requirements, mandatory waiting periods, and ultrasound requirements.

* **Restore federal funding for Planned Parenthood. The Obama-Biden administration fought Republican attacks on funding for Planned Parenthood again and again.** As president, Biden will reissue guidance specifying that states cannot refuse Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood and other providers that refer for abortions or provide related information and reverse the Trump Administration’s rule preventing Planned Parenthood and certain other family planning programs from obtaining Title X funds.

* Just as the Obama-Biden Administration did,President Biden will rescind the Mexico City Policy (also referred to as the global gag rule) that President Trump reinstated and expanded. This rule currently bars the U.S. federal government from supporting important global health efforts – including for malaria and HIV/AIDS – in developing countries simply because the organizations providing that aid also offer information on abortion service

* Reducing our unacceptably high maternal mortality rate, which especially impacts people of color. Compared to other developed nations, the U.S. has the highest rate of deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth, and we are the only country experiencing an increase in this death rate. This problem is especially prevalent among black women, who experience a death rate from complications related to pregnancy that is more than three times higher than the rate for non-Hispanic white women. California came up with a strategy that halved the state’s maternal death rate. As president, Biden will take this strategy nationwide.

* **Defending health care protections for all, regardless of gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation.** Before the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies could increase premiums merely due to someone’s gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Further, insurance companies could increase premiums or deny coverage altogether due to someone’s HIV status. Yet, President Trump is trying to walk back this progress. For example, he has proposed to once again allow health care providers and insurance companies to discriminate based on a patient’s gender identity or abortion history. President Biden will defend the rights of all people – regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity – to have access to quality, affordable health care free from discrimination.

* **Doubling America’s investment in community health centers. Community health centers provide primary, prenatal, and other important care to underserved populations.** The Biden Plan will double the federal investment in these centers, expanding access to high quality health care for the populations that need it most.

* **Achieving mental health parity and expanding access to mental health care.** As Vice President, Biden was a champion for efforts to implement the federal mental health parity law, improve access to mental health care, and eliminate the stigma around mental health. As President, he will redouble these efforts to ensure enforcement of mental health parity laws and expand funding for mental health services.

&gt;**The Biden Plan will make health care a right by getting rid of capital gains tax loopholes for the super wealthy.** Today, the very wealthy pay a tax rate of just 20% on long-term capital gains. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the capital gains and dividends exclusion is the second largest tax expenditure in the entire tax code: $127 billion in fiscal year 2019 alone. As President, Biden will roll back the Trump rate cut for the very wealthy and restore the 39.6% top rate he helped restore when he negotiated an end to the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy in 2012. Biden’s capital gains reform will close the loopholes that allow the super wealthy to avoid taxes on capital gains altogether. The Biden plan will assure those making over $1 million will pay the top rate on capital gains, do",1,1583252081

Obama was that candidate and we're where we are now. This is why republicans win time and time again. They are always united regardless of the candidate and the left always has a division. I encourage you to think strategically and urge the people around you to as well.

The saving grace for Trump is that I think the rest of the world knows he's just a complete moron.  This could make his presidency easier to recover from.

So honestly, I don't know which I'd prefer.  But that's how I've typically voted. Lesser of two evils.  I'm tired of being complicit and I refuse to back a party that continually brings evil.

Trump and his cronies are dismantling the Federal government and installing lifetime appointments for conservative judges. That cannot be undone and he will continue to do so. This election is about slowing the bleeding. There is a good chance that the republicans will still own the Senate and that is dangerous if Trump gets another 4 years.

I totally get where you're coming from with the 'evil is still evil' argument. I used to think that way, but I will tell you this: no Republican thinks that way. No Republican voter thinks that way.

However, Bernie's concept of forcing company's to hand over partial ownership to employees is just crazy.  If he pushes that, companies are going to leave the US.  

I'm with you on the supreme court side of things, and I'm not really sure what we can do about that.  However, I'm not going to vote for someone just because of that.  I think it was Pete, throwing around the idea of a larger supreme court.  I'm hoping Biden will run with Pete as VP and maybe we could see that come to fruition.  As well as term limits!!!

Biden will slow the bleeding.  Biden is also a lot more likely to beat Trump in the general.

Every major pharma company in the country right now is spending millions upon millions of dollars in a race to get a vaccine to the stores and hospitals. Distribution plants have already been set up, in some cases. They are not doing this out of the goodness of their hearts, nor do they have to.

The CEOs of these companies have been in meeting after meeting with Pence and Trump in the last few days, and these meetings have been public and televised, for the most part. You can bet your ass that Trump has told them that if they get therapeutics out as quickly as possible, they will be greatly compensated.

The administration has already pretty-much announced that the government will be covering the bulk of the cost for the vaccine and the therapeutics, and that all health plans will be forced to cover them, including at the hospitals for the poor.

This is one case where a high-priced vaccine isn't going to matter, at all. It will literally hurt no one. A bill like this would only tie the administration's hands, and seriously hinder the effort to save lives by taking away vital capital that Trump has available in order to negotiate with the Pharma companies. This bill is literally the democrats trying to tie Trump's hands as he tries to use them to protect our citizenry. It is shameful, and evil.

Evidence from the article itself:

""They object to a provision that prevents drug manufacturers from overcharging **the government** for any vaccines or other treatment.""

Literally the only reason these companies are rushing out vaccines is because they know the government will over-pay for them. How the f\*\*\* are you going to take away their incentive to do so?!

I have two kids. My oldest is 13, my youngest 9. Both girls.

My youngest told us (her parents) about a year ago that she had a crush on another girl. We talked it over, and she said very clearly that she's never going to like boys, and thinks girls are cute. I believe her - after all, I remembered liking girls by the time I was 7, so there's no reason to be at all surprised when a kid who's a year older than that figures out she's gay.

My oldest just came out to us as well. Took her a little longer than her sister to figure herself out, but everyone's different.

Now then... At the end of this primary season, there will be a Democratic nominee and a Republican nominee. One of those two people will be the next president. A third-party run **will** fail, as they literally always do. It's not an optimal choice, by any means. I am not thrilled with the idea of picking between a literal monster and a right-leaning milquetoast centrist who has made a number of bad legislative decisions in his career.

But one of those men is trying to make discrimination against both of my children legal again, because his moronic, insane, brainwashed base demands it. One of those men is a clear and present danger to the safety and happiness of my kids. One of those men is trying to make them feel ashamed. One of those men is trying to shove them back into the closet.

And one isn't. I'll give you three guesses as to which is which, and the first two don't count.

So for very personal reasons, I consider your position not just one of simplistic reasoning and privilege, but one that is openly accepting of injury to my daughters, out of a misplaced idealism that insists - contrary to the evidence - that Biden and Trump are identical.

They’ll get better very rapidly. They don’t even see a doctor. They don’t even call a doctor. You never hear about those people, so you can’t put them down in the category of the overall population in terms of this corona flu, and, or virus, so you just can’t do that,” Trump said, clearly trying to minimize the danger and the numbers of people infected.

The conclusion.

Biden won the media coverage, hands down. And it stinks to hell if you ask me that the two states that could show a more accurate (and close) race have now taken a freaking week to count.

First, I look at my healthcare expenses (pay period paycheck insurance payments plus 2/3 employer contributions) as a net amount. I don’t care whether I net out through my employer or through the federal government. I’m good either way. I’m not an ideologue.  I care about cost, quality and control. 

I realize it’s ridiculously expensive, about $750 total per check and I’m paid 26 times. I’m a family guy. That amount is more than many make in a year and I work for a huge company. I can’t even imagine the cost on an island. I have a PPO. Kaiser would be materially less but I don’t know exactly how much. 

I’m a fiscal conservative. Which means I’m extremely concerned about the direction of both parties and the abandonment of all sense and decency, especially with the Republican Party hijacked by Trump. We care about the deficit. It matters. There are many college educated middle class suburbanites like me. They stormed the polls in Michigan. You people have awakened the sleeping giant. 

It’s been a Moderate Revolution, at least so far. Bernie’s youth turnout was a dream. 

We don’t trust Bernie Sanders. Many think he is a lot like Trump. We know the system is terribly inefficient but Bernie doesn’t have the answers. He has bumper stickers and his brand. 

The PLOS study is flawed but the M4A movement has shown me there are places to save. PLOS cites the 2 obvious ones, administrative saving and better deals on drugs (and services). Another is a amount of entrepreneurship that could be unleashed if employees could strike out on their own without worry about their insurance. 

The study, like several studies including the Yale study Bernie cited numerous times last debate, cherry-picked numbers from studies that actually estimated those increased M4A costs of $20-35 trillion over a decade. These are cited in PLOS study. I commend them for the discussion but they are cherry-picked and meant to influence you.  Please read the whole thing. 

Age old politics, get elected, sort it out later. 

Your first citation is a political piece written by those with a conflict. It’s not devoid but it is what it is.  The above is a glimpse into the mind of my voter group that sympathizes deeply with your situation but view Sanders as another Donald Trump. 

Please read Thomas Friedman’s most recent editorial. Besides being fiscally conservative I’m socially liberal. That article by a a Pulitzer Prize winning author that has being advocating about climate change for . . . 20 years (?) will help you understand why Bernie is losing so badly.

&gt; As I said in the title, they're personal sources, so please reacquaint yourself with the concept if the implications are not clear. Moreover, they predicted broadstrokes of Trump's announcement beforehand, so their credibility is already established ipso facto.

If your personal source is 4chan, that is a bad source. If your personal source is John Bolton, that is a much better source.

Predicting the broad strokes of Trump's announcement is not hard. Trump's actions were largely predictable; Trump is xenophobic, and hence loves travel bans. In addition, Trump has been talking about 'economic relief' for small businesses for a while, so that aspect is also no surprise.

The only real notable call made is the martial law aspect. But yeah, I can extend the gamble till November. That is cutting it close to the election, and if Trump's odds look poor... well, in that case you might be right.",1,1584049264

297,trump,"&gt;House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday night celebrated the coronavirus legislation that passed early Saturday as providing paid sick leave to American workers affected by the pandemic.

&gt;She neglected to mention the fine print.

&gt;In fact, the bill guarantees sick leave only to about 20 percent of workers. Big employers like McDonald’s and Amazon are not required to provide any paid sick leave, while companies with fewer than 50 employees can seek hardship exemptions from the Trump administration.

&gt;“If you are sick, stay home,” Vice President Mike Pence said at a news conference on Saturday afternoon. “You’re not going to miss a pay check.”

&gt;But that’s simply not true. Sick workers should stay home, but there is no guarantee in the emergency legislation that most of them will get paid.

&gt;The White House and congressional Republicans, who insisted on the exemptions as the price of bipartisan support for the legislation, bear the primary responsibility for the indefensible decision to prioritize corporate profits in the midst of a public health emergency.

&gt;Instead of pressing executives to support a comprehensive sick leave law, President Trump held a Rose Garden pep rally for corporate America on Friday afternoon, showering praise on the chief executives of big employers including Walmart, Target and Walgreens.
But House Democrats also failed to act in the public interest. Paying sick workers to stay at home is both good policy and good politics. Why not pass a bill that required all employers to provide paid sick leave and then force Republicans to explain their objections to the public?

&gt;The bill does require some employers to provide full-time workers with up to 10 days of paid leave. But the requirement does not apply to the nation’s largest employers — companies with 500 or more workers, who together employ roughly 54 percent of all workers.

&gt;After a Waffle House employee tested positive for the coronavirus earlier this month, the company refused to promise it would pay other sick workers to stay home. Now, under the new bill, it would qualify for the big-company exemption. Would Ms. Pelosi please explain why the House decided not to require Waffle House to protect its workers and customers by paying for sick leave?

&gt;The legislation also provides some compensation for workers who need to take longer leaves under the Family and Medical Leave Act — but this too excludes workers at big companies.

&gt;And the bill allows the Labor Department to grant hardship exemptions to businesses with fewer than 50 employees. That category includes another 26 percent of the work force, meaning that fully 80 percent of workers may not be able to cash in on Ms. Pelosi’s rhetoric.

&gt;Democrats began this process in the right place. The first draft of the coronavirus legislation included a permanent change requiring employers to allow every worker to earn up to seven days of paid sick leave, and a temporary change allowing any worker to take up to 10 days of sick leave during a public health emergency. The final draft includes only a pale shadow of those sensible requirements. The paid sick leave requirement is narrowly focused on the coronavirus; it does not even require paid sick leave during future pandemics — a contemptible signal that political leaders are already committed to not learning the lessons of this one.

&gt;Some large employers have announced voluntary grants of paid sick leave for workers affected by the coronavirus. After a Walmart employee in Kentucky tested positive for the coronavirus, the company announced it would provide up to two weeks of paid leave for workers who fall ill or are quarantined because of a confirmed exposure to the virus. Other large employers, including Target, Gap and Wawa, have made similar announcements.

&gt;But such voluntary policies are an inadequate substitute for legislation. Many large employers have not announced any changes, many of the policies that have been announced are considerably less generous than the requirements of the House legislation, and employees at those firms can hardly enforce corporate compliance with a news release.

&gt;It’s also true that big employers are generally more likely to offer standard sick leave benefits. Roughly 86 percent of workers at big companies get some kind of paid sick leave, according to federal statistics. But few workers in the United States are eligible to take 10 days of paid sick leave. And the low-wage workers who can least afford to stay home without paid leave are precisely the workers who are least likely to qualify for those standard corporate benefits.

&gt;Companies should be required to provide paid sick leave to every worker as a standard cost of doing business, and they certainly should be required to do so in the midst of a pandemic.

&gt;The House’s failure to require universal paid sick leave is an embarrassment that endangers the health of workers, consumers and the broader American public.",1,1584234291

**February 2:** “We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.”

**February 24:** “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA… Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”

**February 25:** “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.”

**February 25:** “I think that's a problem that’s going to go away… They have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we’re very close to a vaccine.”

**February 26:** “The 15 (cases in the US) within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.”

**February 26:** “We're going very substantially down, not up.”

**February 27:** “One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.”

**February 28:** “We're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this. But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical.”

**March 2:** “You take a solid flu vaccine, you don't think that could have an impact, or much of an impact, on corona?”

**March 2:** “A lot of things are happening, a lot of very exciting things are happening and they’re happening very rapidly.”

**March 4:** “If we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to **work — some of them go to work, but they get better.”

**March 5:** “I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.”

**March 5:** “The United States… has, as of now, only 129 cases… and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!”

**March 6:** “I think we’re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down… a tremendous job at keeping it down.”

**March 6:** “Anybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. And the tests are beautiful…. the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect. Right? This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.”

**March 6:** “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it… Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”

**March 6:** “I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault.”

**March 8:** “We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus.”

**March 9:** “This blindsided the world.”

&gt; During the signing of the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act last week, President Donald Trump told reporters that the nation was &amp;quot;Doing very well&amp;quot; in dealing with the COVID-19 virus, calling it an &amp;quot;Unforeseen problem&amp;quot; that &amp;quot;Came out of nowhere.&amp;quot; While the exact nature of a viral contagion cannot be exactly predicted, the U.S. Intelligence Community provided a Worldwide Threat Assessment last year explicitly warning that the country was &amp;quot;Vulnerable&amp;quot; to a large-scale outbreak of a contagious disease.

&gt; The DNI Threat Assessment was presented to Congress less than a year after the Trump administration dramatically downsized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&amp;#039;s epidemic prevention activities abroad - which were aimed at stopping future outbreaks at their source.

&gt; &amp;quot;The goal of Predict was to speed up and organize the previously haphazard hunt for zoonotic diseases - those that may jump from animals to humans. In recent years, scientists have discovered many lethal viruses lurking in wild and domestic animals,&amp;quot; the New York Times reported last year.

Yet in the same election, voted for Republican Senator Josh Hawley and overwhelmingly voted down ballot for Republicans who are already working to restrict medical cannabis, reattempt at passing right to work, and trying to say the anti-gerrymandering measure won't work so they are trying to come up with something else on their own. Even with this gaffe of handling of COVID-19 and the market crashing, most would probably still vote Trump than someone that is ""socialist.""

If Sanders won tomorrow 60-40, he might draw even with Biden. If these states split 50-50, he remains 150+ delegates behind Biden. If he loses 40-60, Biden would be ahead 250-300 delegates. In that last case, Sanders would need to win most remaining states 70-30.

So, yes, Sanders still has a chance. Just like you an I have a chance to become billionaires by winning multiple Powerball lotteries.

One thing is absolutely certain: the only way Sanders can win the nomination is with a majority of delegates on the 1st ballot. Time is most definitely running out for him if he can't get all those voters he and you claim he can bring to the polls actually to show up during the primaries.

Biden is offering incremental change that he can actually make happen because he’s spent decades building relationships in Congress and he has a proven track record. Sanders promises big goals that he can never deliver on because no one gets along with him and he’s passed three pieces of legislation with him as the main sponsor (and two were renaming post offices!)

Extremists are motivated, vocal, and more politically active whether they lean left or right. For the Democratic Party to think they can rely on an unmotivated mass of moderates rather than riling up whatever extremist (Progressive) base they have is a major strategic flaw.

If it were true that the way politics work in America were only by gradual change from insiders then Bush, Obama, and Trump wouldn’t have happened. 

Trump is so far from being an insider that he never even held political office before, Obama was only on the national scene for one term on the U.S. Senate. Additionally, Obama’s campaign whether he delivered or not was on sweeping change and change actually became his campaign mantra. Bush wasn’t on Capitol Hill at all and the insider in his primary competition was actually John McCain who was a congressional insider “building relationships” for 13 years before Bush was elected.

Bush and Trump rather than embracing gradual change or bipartisan relationships in congress both made extensive use of sweeping executive orders. Not sure if the same is true for Obama maybe someone else can chime in on that.

Anyway given that the last three presidents were outsiders and campaigned on sweeping change I agree with the sentiment that the Democratic Party really did screw up by backing a so called “moderate” in Biden who truly is an insider, since that ticket didn’t work in at least the last three elections (not sure if Clinton was considered an outsider or extreme but I’d guess he was).

His support came largely from a group that historically does not vote, and they didn't show this time either.  Had he found a way to move them, or if his successor does next time out, something great could happen.  

The DNC is nothing but a group of people who have been very involved in politics, the longer they've been involved the greater their individual influence is likely to be.  They want the democratic party in power, and do what they think is most likely to make that happen.

Want to improve the DNC?  There's only one way, you have to infiltrate it.

There's still some elbowing and maneuvering for room, as you can imagine, but this is a pretty solid-like bipartisan proposal agreed to by a lot of rank-and-file Democrats who were involved in drafting it.""

SCHUMER: ""Early this morning (Sunday), Leader McConnell presented to us a highly partisan bill written exclusively by Republicans, and he said he would call a vote to proceed to it today. So who is being partisan? He knows darn well for this bill to pass it needs both Democratic and Republican support.

""Given more time, I believe we could reach a point where the legislation is close enough to what the nation needs for all senators, all senators to want to move forward,"" Schumer added. ""We are not yet at that point.""

""We need a bill that puts workers first, not corporations,""

MCCONNELL: ""I want everybody to fully understand if we aren't able to act tomorrow, it will be because of our colleagues on the other side continuing to dicker when the country expects us to come together and address the problem,"" McConnell said on the floor. He added that over the last 48 hours there were bipartisan discussions among ""regular members of the Senate, not in the Leadership office, not in the speaker's office for goodness sakes.""

""She's the Speaker of the House, not the Speaker of the Senate,"" McConnell added. ""We were doing just fine until that intervention.""

SCHUMER: ""The majority leader was well aware of how the vote would go before it happened but he chose to go forward with it anyway even though negotiations are continuing,"" Schumer said on the floor. ""So who's playing games? But our caucus is united to deliver a bill that addresses this health and economic crisis quickly and we're committed to working in a bipartisan way to get it done.""

&gt;No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

This is not a State right issue, States do not have any rights here. The orders are rational, so the President is telling States to play a clean game to get assistance, which frankly, is not the only thing he could do. If he wanted to, he could have FEMA issue a lockdown order, and then seize State emergency funds and funnel them into the Federal effort, and issue orders regarding providing protections to essential workers and restrictions on the rights of non essential workers. Instead, he is issuing a warning that States which do not treat people well will not be assisted, which I have to respect.

I should note, I wrote in, I was neither a Trump nor Clinton supporter, and, I never will be, but I cannot jump on the pile on this one.

You have demonstrated that you are a [liar](https://www.reddit.com/r/uspolitics/comments/fprooq/joe_biden_faces_sexual_assault/fln6wdh/), a hypocrite, and that the truth has no bearing on what you say, so whether or not Tara Reade is telling the truth means nothing to you and whether you actually believe anything you say is irrelevant. You've revealed yourself as nothing more than a mercenary doing whatever it takes to get the job done, which is why you accuse others of the same.

Prices have increased significantly mainly due to the US having an aging population, increase in chronic illnesses, and government regulations. People never pay a dime into the insurance system their entire lives until they've given themselves heart disease or diabetes and insurance companies aren't allowed to charge them an appropriate rate. 

Do you genuinely not understand supply and demand? When the government artificially inflates the demand without increasing supply then a rise in prices is inevitable, especially when the government does something like Medicaid expansion considering it's creating a demand for a limited service that is perceived as free by the recipients. Patients that rely solely on Medicare spend 600% more than those with private insurance because they don't care about the bill. 

Oh yeah, I remember you now. You think the top 1% don't pay any taxes because you've never looked at any statistics and read heavily biased editorials. It's the bottom 50% that pay no federal taxes.

&gt; Even though the Trump administration sanctioned the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) in September 2019 for supporting terrorism, the Treasury Department recently took action to allow humanitarian trade transactions involving the CBI. The Treasury could clearly inform banks that Iran is authorized to use the foreign exchange held in CBI accounts abroad, including Iranian oil revenues stuck in escrow accounts in China, Japan, India and South Korea, to finance the importation of goods that will help the government respond to its coronavirus outbreak. 

&gt; But Iran is still struggling to obtain supplies despite technical changes that should make it easier for Iran to access its offshore accounts, and despite the existence of mechanisms designed specifically to ensure that humanitarian supplies can reach the Iranian people.  

&gt; The most significant obstacle is foreign banks, who are wary of U.S. sanctions and inclined to avoid the risk of facilitating these transactions out of an abundance of caution. Iran’s return to the Financial Action Task Force’s blacklist in February is an additional obstacle. U.S. sanctions have broad humanitarian exemptions built in, and personal protective equipment and ventilators are specifically allowable. Even though the Treasury Department allows for the sale to Iran of relevant medical devices and will provide reassurances to banks facilitating these transactions, the fear of U.S. sanctions is a deterrent. There is widespread confusion and concern about not running afoul of U.S. sanctions on Iran.

&gt; The Trump administration could, therefore, do much more on the public diplomacy front to signal that it has no intention of blocking firms and companies for working with Iran to address its coronavirus outbreak. Treasury could issue additional guidance clarifying which humanitarian goods are allowable. In these days of telework, a virtual town hall with senior officials is a no-brainer in order to clarify that the administration will not block the provision, or financing, of medical devices to Iran necessary for treating coronavirus patients. Social media outreach, and even a short statement from the White House podium during the daily Coronavirus Task Force briefings, are easy steps to take.

&gt; The White House also could demonstrate goodwill toward the Iranian people, as distinct from its policy of regime behavior change, by publicly supporting the delivery of humanitarian supplies and work of NGOs. And there is precedent for this. In 2003, the Bush administration issued a 90-day General License that facilitated NGO work in Iran to assist in recovery efforts after the Bam earthquake killed more than 26,000 people. In 2012, the Obama administration issued a 45-day General License to allow NGOs up to $300,000 to Iran for humanitarian and reconstruction activities after earthquakes killed more than 260 people. ",1,1585830799

&gt; ""Since the outbreak of the virus in Iran, we have been observing the U.S.-led anti-Iranian propaganda campaign and know about the measures the Americans have taken to reduce Iranian nation's morale,"" Mousavi told reporters, according to the Mehr News Agency.

&gt; Mousavi added that Tehran is ""doubtful"" about the U.S. offer of help and accused Washington of hiding its political motives behind the proposed cooperation. ""We do not need them,"" Mousavi said.

Reuters

Actual the investigations happen during Obama's time in office. Also the IAEA is an internal team, not just the US. So you are wrong again. 
Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran In November 2011, the IAEA reported credible evidence that Iran had been conducting experiments aimed at designing a nuclear bomb until 2003, and that research may have continued on a smaller scale after that time.

On 11 April 2006, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced that Iran had successfully enriched uranium. President Ahmadinejad made the announcement in a televised address from the northeastern city of Mashhad, where he said ""I am officially announcing that Iran joined the group of those countries which have nuclear technology."" The uranium was enriched to 3.5 per cent using over a hundred centrifuges.

On 13 April 2006, after US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said (on 12 April 2006) the Security Council must consider ""strong steps"" to induce Tehran to change course in its nuclear ambition; President Ahmadinejad vowed that Iran will not back away from uranium enrichment and that the world must treat Iran as a nuclear power, saying ""Our answer to those who are angry about Iran achieving the full nuclear fuel cycle is just one phrase. We say: Be angry at us and die of this anger,"" because ""We won't hold talks with anyone about the right of the Iranian nation to enrich uranium.""[122]

On 14 April 2006, The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) published a series of analyzed satellite images of Iran's nuclear facilities at Natanz and Esfahan.[123] Featured in these images is a new tunnel entrance near the Uranium Conversion Facility (UCF) at Esfahan and continued construction at the Natanz uranium enrichment site. In addition, a series of images dating back to 2002 shows the underground enrichment buildings and its subsequent covering by soil, concrete, and other materials. Both facilities were already subject to IAEA inspections and safeguards.

On 28 July 2006, the UN Security Council approved a resolution to give Iran until the end of August to suspend uranium enrichment or face the threat of sanctions.[124]

Iran responded to the demand to stop enrichment of uranium 24 August 2006, offering to return to the negotiation table but refusing to end enrichment.[125]

Qolam Ali Hadad-adel, speaker of Iran's parliament, said on 30 August 2006, that Iran had the right to ""peaceful application of nuclear technology and all other officials agree with this decision,"" according to the semi-official Iranian Students News Agency. ""Iran opened the door to negotiations for Europe and hopes that the answer which was given to the nuclear package would bring them to the table.""[125]

In Resolution 1696 of 31 July 2006, the United Nations Security Council demanded that Iran suspend all enrichment and reprocessing related activities.[126]

In UN Security Council Resolution 1737 of 26 December 2006, the Council imposed a series of sanctions on Iran for its non-compliance with the earlier Security Council resolution deciding that Iran suspend enrichment-related activities without delay.[127] These sanctions were primarily targeted against the transfer of nuclear and ballistic missile technologies[128] and, in response to concerns of China and Russia, were lighter than that sought by the United States.[129] This resolution followed a report from the IAEA that Iran had permitted inspections under its safeguards agreement but had not suspended its enrichment-related activities.[130]

But you like blaming only the US when the UN implement the sanctions.

**Jan. 22**

“We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.”

**January 24**

“It will all work out well.”

**January 30**

“We have it very well under control. We have very little problem in this country at this moment — five. And those people are all recuperating successfully.”

**February 2**

“Well, we pretty much shut it down coming in from China. We have a tremendous relationship with China, which is a very positive thing. Getting along with China, getting along with Russia, getting along with these countries.”

**Feb. 10**

“Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away.”

**February 19**

“I think the numbers are going to get progressively better as we go along.”

**February 23**

“We have [coronavirus] very much under control in this country.” ... “We had 12 [people with the disease], at one point.  And now they’ve gotten very much better.  Many of them are fully recovered.”

**Feb. 24**

“The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. … Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”

**February 26**

""We're going very substantially down, not up… When you have 15 people and the 15 within a couple days is going to be down to close to zero, that's a pretty good job we've done.”

**February 26**

""This is a flu. This is like a flu,"" Trump repeated. ""It's a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for. And we'll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner.”

**Feb 28**

“It’s going to disappear. One day, it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.”

**February 29**

“my administration has taken the most aggressive action in modern history to confront the spread of this disease.”

**March 2**

“We’re talking about a much smaller range of deaths than from the flu,” 

**March 4**

“Some people will have this at a very light level and won’t even go to a doctor or hospital, and they’ll get better. There are many people like that.” 

**March 6**

“Anybody that wants a test can get a test.”

**March 7**

“It will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.”

**March 7**

“No, I’m not concerned at all. No, I’m not. No, we’ve done a great job.”

**March 9**

""So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life &amp; the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!”

**March 9**

“The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power ... to inflame the CoronaVirus situation.” 

**March 10**

“We’re prepared, and we’re doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.”

**March 13**

“I don't take responsibility at all,”

**March 14**

“We’re using the full power of the federal government to defeat the virus, and that’s what we’ve been doing.”

**March 15**

“This is a very contagious virus. It’s incredible. But it’s something that we have tremendous control over.”

**March 17**

“I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.” 

**March 18**

“I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the ‘borders’ from China - against the wishes of almost all.”

**19**

“We took the best economy we’ve ever had and we said ‘Stop. You can’t work. You have to stay home.’ ... Here’s a case we’re paying a lot of money to stop things because we don’t want people to be together so that this virus doesn’t continue onward.”

**March 23**

“America will again, and soon, be open for business — very soon — a lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting. ... We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.”

**March 24**

“I’d love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter... It’s such an important day for other reasons, but I’d love to make it an important day for this. I would love to have the country opened up, and raring to go by Easter.” 

**March 25**

""The LameStream Media is the dominant force in trying to get me to keep our Country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success. The real people want to get back to work ASAP. We will be stronger than ever before!”

**March 26**

“I don’t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. You know, you go into major hospitals sometimes they’ll have two ventilators, and now all of a sudden they’re saying, ‘Can we order 30,000 ventilators?’”

**March 28**

“WE WILL WIN THIS WAR. When we achieve this victory, we will emerge stronger and more united than ever before!”

**March 29**

“President Trump is a ratings hit. Since reviving the daily White House briefing Mr. Trump and his coronavirus updates have attracted an average audience of 8.5 million on cable news, roughly the viewership of the season finale of ‘The Bachelor.’ Numbers are continuing to rise... 

**March 29**

""Well, I've read that CNN doesn't want to cover them. I've read that -- except they can't help them because their ratings are so high. You know, if the ratings were low, they wouldn't be here. This man wouldn't be here. In 100 years you could bet your life that he would never be here with CNN and all their cameras....because we help their ratings. We help -- we lift up their ratings because their ratings are very low. ... But I think the American public ultimately they should be the decider, it's like if they don't want to watch, they shouldn't watch.”

**March 29**

""Because the “Ratings” of my News Conferences etc. are so high, “Bachelor finale, Monday Night Football type numbers” according to the @nytimes, the Lamestream Media is going CRAZY. “Trump is reaching too many people, we must stop him.” said one lunatic. See you at 5:00 P.M.!""

**March 31**

“So you’re talking about 2.2 million deaths, 2.2 million people from this. And so if we could hold that down, as we’re saying, to 100,000. It’s a horrible number, maybe even less — but to 100,000. So we have between 100 and 200,000, and we altogether have done a very good job.”

**April 1**

“Frankly, I don‘t think they will be mandatory because some people don‘t want to do that, but if people wanted, as an example on the masks, if people wanted to wear them, they can. If people wanted to use scarves — which they have, many people have them — they can,“

**April 2**

""a lot of people"" had previously suggested the country should simply let the coronavirus take its course, just like the seasonal flu.”

Just a month ago Donald Trump was still insisting that Covid-19 was a trivial issue, comparing it to the “common flu.” And he dismissed economic concerns; after all, during flu season, “nothing is shut down, life &amp; the economy go on.”

But pandemics come at you fast. Since Trump’s blithe dismissal, something like 15 million Americans have lost their jobs — the economic implosion is happening so quickly that official statistics can’t keep up.

In our last economic crisis the economy shrank around 6 percent relative to its long-run trend, and the unemployment rate rose around five percentage points. At a guess, we’re now looking at a slump three to five times that deep.

And this plunge isn’t just quantitatively off the charts; it’s qualitatively different from anything we’ve seen before. Normal recessions happen when people choose to cut spending, with the unintended consequence of destroying jobs. So far this slump mainly reflects the deliberate, necessary shutdown of activities that increase the rate of infection.

As I’ve been saying, it’s the economic equivalent of a medically induced coma, in which some brain functions are temporarily shut down to give the patient a chance to heal.

Paul Krugman’s Newsletter: Get a better understanding of the economy — and an even deeper look at what’s on Paul’s mind.

While a deep slump is unavoidable, however, good policies could do a lot to minimize the amount of hardship Americans experience. The problem is that the U.S. political landscape has long been dominated by an anti-government ideology that left us unprepared, intellectually and institutionally, for this crisis.

What should we be doing? Serious economists have already reached a rough consensus over the appropriate policy response to a pandemic. The bottom line is that this isn’t a conventional recession, which calls for broad-based economic stimulus. The immediate mission, beyond an all-out effort to contain the pandemic itself, should instead be disaster relief: generous aid to those suffering a sudden loss of income as a result of the economy’s lockdown.

It’s true that we could suffer a second round of job losses if the victims of the lockdown slash spending on other goods and services. But adequate disaster relief would address this problem, too, helping to sustain demand.

So it’s all about helping the economic victims of the coronavirus lockdown. How are we doing?

The good news is that thanks to Democratic pressure, the CARES Act, the $2 trillion not-a-stimulus bill that became law less than three weeks after Trump dismissed the notion that Covid-19 might pose an economic problem, is mostly focused on the right things. The core provisions of the legislation are aid to hospitals, the unemployed and small businesses that maintain their payrolls; these are exactly the kinds of things we should be doing.

What’s especially remarkable is that we got mostly sensible legislation even though the president was talking nonsense, pushing for — what else? — tax cuts as the solution for the economy’s problems. Actually, I can’t think of any other recent example in which Republicans agreed to major fiscal legislation that mainly involved spending to benefit the needy, without any tax cuts for the rich.

The bad news comes in two parts.

First, the bill falls far short of what’s needed on one crucial dimension: aid to state governments, which are on the front line of dealing with the pandemic. Unlike the federal government, states have to balance their budgets each year. Now they’re facing a surge in costs and huge revenue losses; unless they get a lot more aid, they’ll be forced to cut spending sharply, which will directly undermine essential services and indirectly deepen the overall slump.

And it’s not clear when or whether that hole will be filled. Senate Republicans are hostile to the idea of another rescue package; White House officials are reportedly still talking about tax cuts.

Second, decades of hostility to government have left us poorly positioned to deliver even the aid Congress has voted. State unemployment offices have been underfunded for a long time, and red states have deliberately made it hard to apply for benefits. So the surge in unemployment is overwhelming the benefits system; Congress may have voted disaster relief, but the money isn’t flowing.

The loan program for small businesses is also, by all accounts, off to a shambolic start. And those $1,200 checks everyone is supposed to get? Many Americans won’t get them for weeks or months.

It doesn’t have to be like this. Canada has already set up a special web portal and phone system to provide emergency unemployment benefits. Germans have been pleasantly surprised by how quickly aid is flowing to the self-employed and small businesses.

But decades of conservative attacks on the idea that government can do anything good have left America with a unique case of learned helplessness. And this is combined with utter lack of leadership from the top.

We know what we should be doing in terms of economic policy, and Congress passed a relief bill that, while flawed, was better than I expected. But right now it looks as if our response to the economic emergency will fall far short.",1,1586275386

Black Democratic voters support Biden. I've read their words and can understand it. He was the VP for Obama, a black man, for 8 years and never once tried to take over or usurp Obama's power. He was a true ally. This carries a lot of weight in a world where racism is so systemic, it's impossible to get away from. Black voters are a large part of our base, so they have a lot of hurdles to clear, put in their way by elected officials who specifically do not want them to vote. So turning out, getting to polling places, making that decision is an act of defiance and revolution.

Democrats will vote for Biden because the other choice is Trump. Unlike 2016, when no one believed Trump could actually win, protest votes were a thing. Now we have a deadly virus that this piece of shit President is immune to and he is using that to take everything for himself. He doesn't care if you die. In fact, if you are a Democratic voter, he WANTS YOU TO DIE. If you die, you can't vote him out of office and he can continue, unimpeded, taking the American taxpayer for every dime we have. No one matters to him except him. Everyone else is expendable. So, if someone votes for Jill Stein or writes in Bernie this time, they are cutting everyone's throat. And we all know it.

The President is an important office, but none of this matters if the Senate remains in Mitch McConnell's hands. If it does, then nothing matters and we all die. The President and the House can write all the laws they want, but the Senate has to approve them too. We already lived through that nightmare and we know they stop any and all attempts to help Americans. And because we have a corrupt Senate, we have a corrupt SCOTUS. Because we have a corrupt SCOTUS, our protections as a nation are in jeopardy. All McConnell cared about was getting that majority. Now, they can do anything they like and the SCOTUS will uphold it. The President means nothing now that McConnell has what he was after. If he leaves office, he still won. And everyone who isn't a rich, white, CIS man loses.

So we have to vote for Joe. And we have to vote every, single Republican down ticket out of office. We need to get rid of every impediment to justice or we will never see the next election. We know what's at stake. That's why everyone in my house is voting for Joe Biden.",1,1586432373

1.) Eliminate oversight of the spending of nearly a trillion dollars of tax dollars. [(3)](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/490737-stimulus-opens-new-front-in-trumps-oversight-fight)

2.) Acquire the authority to command which businesses get which contracts. [(4)](https://youtu.be/MlQx7Qs2ACI)

3.) Have trusted people stand up companies through which the money can be funneled (3 week old company, founded through a loan approved via the Coronavirus Stimulus bill, is now the center of medical supply distribution): [(5)](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/27/republican-fundraiser-company-coronavirus-152184) “I don’t want to overstate, but we probably represent the largest global supply chain for Covid-19 supplies right now,” he said. “We are getting ready to fill 100 million-unit mask orders.”

4.) Have the federal government sell, at a reduced price, it’s strategic stockpile to the new companies, run by your buddies. [(6)](https://twitter.com/DavidBegnaud/status/12458414583237713933)

5.) Have the states bid on the supplies, driving up the price. [(7)](https://youtu.be/2zeEUs7tcpE)

6.) Have the federal government spend taxpayer dollars to ship supplies purchased from China to these brand new private companies. [(8)](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/29/823543513/project-airbridge-to-expedite-arrival-of-needed-supplies-white-house-says)

7.) Eliminate the competition. Attack any company that doesn’t play ball. [(9)](https://mothership.sg/2020/04/trump-3m-10-million-masks/)

States are having to smuggle in supplies aboard sports teams jets, and escort them with state police [(10)](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/a-million-n95-masks-are-coming-from-chinaon-board-the-new-england-patriots-plane-11585821600). Is it really to this point that we're going to have to have states deploy the national guard to protect their shipments and supplies and treat the federal government like the enemy?

This is no different from the Somalian government stealing food sent by the United Nations and cartels selling it illegally. [(11)](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/10/aid-somalia-stolen-un-report)

892,trump,"I'm going to preface this by saying I didn't actually vote for Biden.  My state is a Super Tuesday state, and there were a few more candidates to choose from back then (you know, five or six centuries ago).  I voted for Warren then because I honestly thought (and still believe) that she was the candidate with the best set of mental tools to actually \*be\* president.

But, after Warren dropped out, I supported Biden.  For a couple reasons:  
1) I felt what I felt in 2016, that if we nominated Sanders, he was too easy to paint as extremist and crazy (I'm not saying I think that portrayal is accurate, just that it would be easy to do).  And as with 2016, in 2020 democrats need to keep as many paths to 270 electoral votes as possible (something Hillary Clinton didn't really understand as she put nearly all of her eggs in her stupid ""Blue Firewall of PA, OH, and MI"" strategy, which she didn't even effectively campaign on as she didn't visit those states enough, or states like it, to be sure she could win them).  That means the candidate needs to be \*capable\* of winning through multiple combinations of states.  For example: (a) winning a majority of upper midwest ""rust belt"" type states (PA, OH, MI, WI, MN, IA), and/or (b) winning the ""retirement"" (FL, AZ, and to a lesser extent NV), and/or (c) turning one or more of the ""I know they've been red for like 30 years, but I swear these states are turning purple"" states (NC, TX, GA); and/or (d) winning back a state that was more of a swing state or a democratic state historically but that has been reliably red recently (MO, NM); and/or pull off a surprise upset in what was believed to be a solidly red state (like the KS and KY governorship's recently).  While Sanders certainly could pull off some of those paths, there are other that would be difficult if not impossible for Sanders (off the top of my head, the ""rust belt"" path would be pretty difficult because they have a big population of moderate to mildly conservative voters that would rather either stay home or vote for Trump than vote for a ""socialist,"" the ""I swear they'll be purple"" states would probably be pretty tough too, as would the ""surprise flip"").  And while some of the paths are not necessarily likely outcomes with Biden, they are still possible (so long as the campaign is run well).

2) I've gotten pretty tired of the narrative that Sanders supports have been spouting online that Sanders is the only ""true progressive"" and that Biden is just a corporate-owned shill.  While there are some clear differences on the margins, the two are much closer on the political spectrum than Sanders supporters are willing to admit.  And while it doesn't go as far as many would like, Biden's platform will still be the most progressive of any two-party general election candidate in history.

3) Finally, based on the way the primary has gone, it's looking more and more like it wasn't so much that Sanders had tapped into some seething, widespread movement that had captured the majority of Americans, but rather that there were A LOT of voters who really didn't like Hillary Clinton and would literally vote for ANYONE but her.  That's clearly one of the reasons that Biden has been able to rack up really big winning margins against Sanders despite the fact that he didn't really have much money and wasn't really campaigning that much while Sanders had a huge war chest and was holding massive rallies everywhere.  That logic will still hold in the general election.  Whether Sanders supporters want to admit it or not, Biden is not even close to Hillary Clinton in the eyes of those types of voters.  Clinton was viewed as a corrupt and shrewd Washington insider who just wanted power and didn't care about ""the people"" at all (whether that was a fair portrayal or just a hugely sexist one is not something I'll address here).  Biden is viewed much more favorably because he generally gives the impression of being a likable person who cares for people and wants to do what's best for them (at least to me, and I didn't vote for him).  Even though his view of ""what's best for the people"" might different from yours or mine, I get the impression (and I think it comes across this way to the public as a whole) that he genuinely wants to figure out what ""the best"" is and cares about getting it right, so he might be persuadable on things that he is still woefull behind the times on.

TL:DR - Biden has the ability to win more potential paths to the presidency, is more progressive than people give him credit for, and is NOT Hillary Clinton.",1,1586446403

Trump is right that a Democrat, Evers, holds the state’s highest office. But Republicans control the other two branches.

Bless their hearts...

They celebrated when he moved the US embassy to Jerusalem, declaring it the capital. This was because, according to their teachings, this was a sign they would be experiencing the Rapture soon. I have seen car bumper stickers that say ""In case of Rapture, this car will be driverless.""

So, here's my multitude of problems with this thinking.

First, let's assume it's a real thing and people just BAMF away. This asshole is ""warning"" us that their car will be careening into traffic, causing mayhem, and they are okay with that. The Evangelicals who supported trump to bring this hell to earth did it on purpose, believing they will not suffer for it. So, the children in cages, suffering and dying, are collateral damage for these Evangelicals to get to Cris Angel into Heaven. They CHOSE these tortures, the groundswell of deaths from this pandemic, all of it just so THEY, and only they, get to fast travel to sit at the right hand of God.

Second, wasn't the Rapture supposed to clear those fuckers out BEFORE all the Horsemen got here? So, if there hasn't been some huge ascension,  which would have made the news, then... Sounds like maybe their God looked at the damage and thought, ""Yeah, no.""

Third, when all this is brought up to them, they simply postpone it. ""This isn't the REAL Apocalypse.  I can tell because we're still here."" So, it's gonna get worse? And you're ROOTING for that? Seriously?

Fourth, these Pastors up there, holding Pay-Per-View court, keep saying, ""Have faith! Have faith!"" Yeah, but Lonnie dying of Coronavirus, when he and Wanda are the epitome of what Jesus was teaching? You tryin' to tell me they weren't good enough to Rapture up? They weren't faithful enough?

&gt;President Trump

&gt;on Friday described the decision on when and how to reopen the country as the most difficult one he’s had to make in his life, underscoring the careful line he is walking between concerns about the economy and public health during the coronavirus outbreak.

&gt;“I don’t know that I’ve had a bigger decision. But I’m going to surround myself with the greatest minds. Not only the greatest minds, but the greatest minds in numerous different businesses, including the business of politics and reason,” Trump told reporters at a White House press briefing.

&gt;“And we’re going to make a decision, and hopefully it’s going to be the right decision,” he continued. “I will say this. I want to get it open as soon as we can.”

&gt;Asked what metrics he would use to come to a final conclusion, he pointed at his head, making clear he felt the burden will rest on his shoulders.

&gt;Trump has appeared eager to relax social distancing guidelines recommended by the White House coronavirus task force in order to get Americans back to work, and some officials have suggested in recent days that businesses could prepare to reopen in May. 

&gt;But public health experts have warned about the risk of reopening the country too early, which could set up a nightmare scenario where COVID-19 again surges in communities and overwhelms hospitals.

&gt;“This idea that on May 1 we can just turn the switch, this will not be good from a public health perspective or for our economy,” said Anand Parekh, chief medical adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center. 

&gt;“Not only are you risking a second wave, but a further economic closure,” continued Parekh, who served as Health and Human Services deputy assistant secretary for health between 2008 and 2015. “I think it’s really important to get this right the first time as opposed to opening up too early.” 

&gt;One of the key hurdles to safely reopening the country, according to health experts, is a lack of widely available testing that would help officials quickly determine the source of potential outbreaks.

&gt;But Trump has shrugged off that concern the past two days, saying at briefings he thinks mass testing would be a benefit, but not a necessity. He argued Friday that parts of the farm belt, for example, could get back to work sooner than the rest of the country because it is less densely populated.

&gt;“You don’t have to test every person in the state of Iowa, as an example. You don’t have to test every single person to say ‘let’s open up and let’s get the tractors moving,’” Trump said. “Now with that being said, if there's a little hot corner some place, we’ll be testing.”

&gt;There were more than 486,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. as of Friday afternoon and more than 18,000 people in the U.S. have died of the virus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

&gt;Those figures have been held down largely by statewide stay-at-home orders and federal guidelines that urge Americans to avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people. Still, the federal advisory is set to expire after April 30 and some top Trump officials have already suggested that parts of the economy could reopen shortly thereafter.

&gt;Even if Trump decides to relax the guidelines, the decision to reduce restrictions like stay-at-home orders and business closures would ultimately fall to states that implemented them.

&gt;U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams on Friday pumped the brakes on the possibility that wide swaths of America would reopen at the beginning of May, telling Fox News in an interview that only places that have seen low levels of COVID-19 and have implemented sufficient surveillance techniques to detect and contain further outbreaks would be able to consider opening up by then. 

&gt;“There are places around the country that have seen consistently low levels and as we ramp up testing and can feel more confident that these places actually can do surveillance and can do public health follow-up, some places will be able to think about opening on May 1,” Adams said Friday morning. 

&gt;“Most of the country will not, to be honest with you, but some will. That’s how we’ll reopen the country: place by place, bit by bit, based on the data,” he added.

&gt;Adams’s remarks came a day after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin

&gt;said he believed companies could reopen in May so long as Trump “feels comfortable with the medical issues,” while White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow

&gt;expressed hope the country could begin reopening on a rolling basis in four to eight weeks.

&gt;Some outside advisers have pushed Trump to reopen parts of the country that have not seen significant spread of the virus by May 1, warning of severe economic depression otherwise. 

&gt;To map out a potential reopening, Trump said he will unveil members of a new group Tuesday that he dubbed the “Opening Our Country Council.” The cohort is expected to include administration officials, business leaders and political figures from around the country.

&gt;The coronavirus pandemic has crippled the U.S. economy in recent weeks. Stringent social distancing guidelines have shuttered businesses across the country and millions of Americans have applied for unemployment benefits. Forecasters warn unemployment could hit 20 percent in the coming weeks as the country works to get the virus under control.

&gt;But the strength of the economy has been at the center of Trump’s reelection argument, and he has been fixated on certain financial markers even amid the pandemic.

&gt;He referenced a stock market rally this week during Friday’s briefing, citing it as evidence that businesses had “pent-up demand” and would bounce back upon the easing of restrictions. And when asked why his administration wasn’t better prepared to prevent coronavirus from ravaging at-risk minority communities, he pivoted to talking about low unemployment numbers for African Americans during his administration.

&gt;Trump has repeatedly insisted that he will listen to recommendations from top health officials like Anthony Fauci

&gt;and Deborah Birx when making a decision on when and how to relax the guidelines. But the president has been careful not to commit to taking their advice, saying he will consider a variety of opinions and ultimately reach a decision on his own. 

&gt;“I listen to them about everything. I think they are actually surprised. I have great respect for these people, all of them, and others that are working for us,” Trump told reporters Friday when asked whether he would heed their advice if they recommended against reopening the country in early May. 

&gt;“I will certainly listen,” Trump continued later. “I understand the other side of the argument very well.""",1,1586590039

I saw people were *complaining* that 68% of American ICU beds were filled at any given point. That is RIDICULOUSLY low. The US is also the largest manufacturer of ventilators and second for respirators. More than half of the world's ventilators are in the US right now, and that share is increasing as more are made.

East Asia is not out of the woods. There is a year between now and a vaccine for another outbreak can occur, and containment might not work every time. It's stopped working for Japan, where I work. Tokyo is supposedly under lockdown right now, but it's kabuki theater. So many jobs are considered essential that it pretty much isn't doing anything.

Current news reports in the US tie the bulk of the outbreak in New York to travel from Europe. If so, perhaps Trump's ban on travel from Europe was several weeks late.

Whatever. The main problem in the US is lack of testing. If Trump is serious about opening up, the US needs the ability to test millions per day.

I prefer Bernie's policies and proposals over Biden, but Bernie has stepped out so that's no longer an option. Now we have to step back and look at the big picture.

Even Bernie warned us how disastrous a Trump presidency would be in 2016: [Bernie Sanders Says He Will Vote for Hillary Clinton (to Defeat Donald Trump)](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/25/us/politics/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton.html)

&gt; “The issue right here is I’m going to do everything I can do to defeat Donald Trump. I think Trump, in so many ways, would be a disaster for this country if he were elected.”

And he was right.

Sure, the DNC pulled some shit because they were convinced America was ready for it's first female President. And the popular vote proved that most of America was, but the minority that wasn't simply played dirty on a massive scale.

If the 10% of Bernie supporters who protested by voting for Tump or the random voters who threw away their votes on Jill Stein had held their nose and voted for Hillary, we wouldn't have this whole Trump mess. We'd still have McConnell trying to deadlock everything, but at least we'd have a more balanced Supreme Court. And we'd already be on the recovery from Covid-19 instead of heading deeper into it with a $2 Trillion blank check, among many other things...

At this point, we have to take the White House and Senate and increase our House majority if we have any hope of making meaningful change. Biden isn't necessarily the long-term answer, but four more years of Trump's lunacy will completely squash any progress towards the ideals that we've all been fighting for.

We need to massively overwhelm all their election fraud and voter manipulation by simply outvoting every Republican at the polls. And 2018 proved that we can do it, if we all pull together.

So instead of turning your justified stubbornness against Biden (just like they want you to do), turn it instead towards defeating Trump and the GOP so that we can all start moving forward.

So vote against Trump no matter what, and fill the down-ballot with as many progressive candidates that you can. Then do it again in 2022, and then we can look towards 2024 and beyond.

But if TЯump and Company manage to steal another election, then things will only get worse for everyone, and progressive progress will not only stop, but entirely revert.

I'm also not going to sit here and pretend that Biden will be good on any of the issues that you just cited.

It's true that he wants a public option, but that's a way to take the sickest and neediest patients off private insurance and putting it on the taxpayer, increasing the profitability of insurance companies. It's a corporate handout. Now, let's talk about Biden on judges. First, Biden is the reason that we have Clarence Thomas on the Court. He personally stopped Anita Hill from calling corroborating witnesses, leading to personal attacks impugning her character and providing a path for Thomas to get on the Court. Second, Biden presided over the Senate during Obama's first term, and they had no inclination to hasten the confirmation of Democratic judges despite controlling the presidency and the upper house of congress. In the infamous words of Rahm Immanuel: ""[We] don't care about judges."" So, make no mistake, Biden was a part of the problem with judges in this country.

Yes. I think we would have had to share the ticket with a centrist type like Pete or Amy or Liz to show deference to a major constituency that we would need to support in kind to win.

992,trump,"How would a staggered opening up take place?

Would each state decide when it opens up? This would be consistent with each state deciding whether to shut down, with the federal government under President Timid trying to avoid any semblance of responsibility or nationwide decision-making.

At the moment there are only 2 states with few than 300 cases, and only one with no reported COVID-19 deaths so far, but opening up Wyoming and Alaska may not do much for the national economy.

There there are states with governors who've shown substantial reservoirs of idiocy, e.g., Noem in South Dakota who continues to refuse to impose statewide stay at home orders. SD cases per capita are now higher than Florida. In states applying piecemeal ad hoc approaches, it may not be safe for the whole state to reopen until late July.

More practically, how would, say, California prevent South Dakotans from entering California since it's unlikely the do-nothing Trump administration would apply border controls at South Dakota's borders with neighboring states?

As for county by county, as yet there are no cases in Modoc and Lassen counties in California, which isn't surprising because they lack ski resorts or any other winter tourist attractions; they're cattle ranch country with some fishing streams. Will they remain case-free when the weather warms, and people from Reno-Sparks head north on US 395 to go fishing? We're also talking some of the sparsest populated parts of California with damn few hospitals.

On a different tack, San Bernardino county in California is the largest single county in the US outside Alaska. It has greater area than 9 states. Most of it is the Mojave desert, and that part of it is nearly case-free. However, it's southwest corner has the city of San Bernardino and is part of the greater Los Angeles metro area, and that's where most of its cases are, though there are some others in Victorville and Barstow. Does it make sense to manage this county as a county?

Finally, would any ***safe*** counties have interstate or US highways running through them? If so, how would they remain safe if truckers traveling between unsafe counties went though them? Truckers would need to remain in their cabs? No self-serve gas, er, diesel? Attendants in hazmat gear collect payment from truckers? Where would truckers, er, relieve themselves? Separate port-a-potties for the possibly infected?

Trump and Kushner could reap a pandemic windfall

&gt;Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) have insisted that Congress spend another $250 billion on small businesses devastated by the pandemic, but they refuse to “renegotiate unrelated programs” from last month’s emergency coronavirus bill.
&gt;What are they afraid of?
&gt;Well, maybe it’s this: As the dust settles on the $2.2 trillion legislation, it has become clear that one of its largest provisions, a $170 billion tax giveaway, appears to be tailor-made for the benefit of wealthy real estate investors such as President Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is running one of Trump’s coronavirus task forces.
The giveaway, **primarily to real estate investors and hedge funds**, is larger than the total amount in the legislation for hospitals ($100 billion) and for relief for all state and local governments ($150 billion). Worse, the bonanza for these millionaires and billionaires has little to do with the coronavirus: It lets them offset losses not just from 2020 but from 2018 and 2019, before the pandemic.

1058,trump,"My dad is a trump supporter, but smart elsewhere. Ive spent the last year or so trying to figure this out.  

Two books that helped me were *the Republican brain* and *authoritarianism and polarization in american politics*. From what I've been able to understand, the political left and right in the US have self sorted themselves pretty well by this point, largely due to the electoral college resulting in the two party system. Conservatism has been characterized by multiple studies in these books by viewing outsiders and change as a threat, being more emotionally minded (in that they get caught in amygdala hijack far more frequently than more left leaning Americans), and strongly prefer simple black and white answers to things over shades of grey.  They also show the tendency to fall prey to motivated reasoning far more often than the political left (according to the studies mentioned in the two books above).

A lot of what I've observed from others is finally someone is voicing their disdain for the political left who they view as an enemy as opposed to fellow Americans. Many don't have an understanding of judicial interpretation when it comes to the US constitution and only believe in a strict, word for word understanding of it, a very closed form, black and white interpretation and have hated politicians who have, in my opinion benevolently, interpreted the US constitution in a none ""strict"" fashion.

There is also a HUGE echo chamber in the political right as they only will pay attention to right leaning media, and in some cases ""right leaning experts"". Some of the studies spoken about in the aforementioned books explore that as a result of being more emotionally minded, conservatives are more likely to suffer cognitive dissonance when facts challenge their established world view, which in turn forces them back to their echo chambers.

I've also found, anecdotally, that most will not investigate their news sources and take whatever they're told to be true, whether it's a biased youtube personality, opinion based right leaning media, or just hearsay among friends, which again shows signs of motivated reasoning.

Also, I believe white privilege plays a large part. In my view, privilege is defined by what you cannot experience, or what you've never been forced to experience. Many of these people havent forced themselves outside of their comfort zones to learn about their own privileges and as a result constantly feel like they're being attacked for being white. Again, they finally have someone that will talk shit about the people who have made them feel bad.

1106,trump,"State governments operate under the Federal government, but as long as they largely follow federal laws, they're given a lot more autonomy for how to handle laws in their states. This is why you can buy liquor in Costco in California but not Montana: different laws and different political scenes.

The federal government continues to have mixed messaging with the Center for Disease Control pushing for more and more aggressive measures to curb the spread of the virus, while the president has both delayed action and mishandled the distribution of medical supplies. Normally, the federal government would distribute supplies according to what is most appropriate or equitable in a given crisis. Trump is having individual state governments basically bid against one another for the medical supplies in the Federal stash. This makes the supplies more expensive for the state governments, and brings more profits to the companies who make those supplies.

When you see that some people are handling this better than others, you are seeing some governors, like Gavin Newsom and Andrew Cuomo, taking scientists seriously, while others, like DeSantis, ignoring the research. Each state is kind of operating on its own with such little leadership at the federal level.

An extreme conservative minority is protesting the stay-at-home order because they are concerned, among other things, about civil liberties being restricted and key agricultural goods being restricted in specific states.

As to why so many Americans are conservative, I'd rather not drive down the rabbit hole of how our representative system works, the structural problems with the electoral college, or our corporatized media that tends to either fit into a strictly conservative or neoliberal box.

1123,trump,"&gt; He restored our nation's greatness by reversing the many failures of Barack Obama.

This is false. Obama restored America's greatness after the many failures of George W. Bush. Don the Con brought us down lower than we've ever been and has made us the laughing stock of the world. 

This year's deficit will be twice the highest deficit under Obama. We'll have to spend years or decades repairing the damage Lyin' Donnie has done to our global relationships. The destruction this thin-skinned, short-fingered vulgarian has wrought on our institutions of government may never be completely repaired. I'll leave you with this:

Someone asked ""Why do some British people not like Donald Trump?"" Nate White, an articulate and witty writer from England wrote the following response:

A few things spring to mind. Trump lacks certain qualities which the British traditionally esteem. For instance, he has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace – all qualities, funnily enough, with which his predecessor Mr. Obama was generously blessed.

So for us, the stark contrast does rather throw Trump's limitations into embarrassingly sharp relief.
Plus, we like a laugh. And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing – not once, ever.

I don't say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever. And that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility – for us, to lack humour is almost inhuman.
But with Trump, it's a fact. He doesn't even seem to understand what a joke is – his idea of a joke is a crass comment, an illiterate insult, a casual act of cruelty. Trump is a troll. And like all trolls, he is never funny and he never laughs; he only crows or jeers.

And scarily, he doesn't just talk in crude, witless insults – he actually thinks in them. His mind is a simple bot-like algorithm of petty prejudices and knee-jerk nastiness. There is never any under-layer of irony, complexity, nuance or depth. It's all surface.
Some Americans might see this as refreshingly upfront. Well, we don't. We see it as having no inner world, no soul. And in Britain we traditionally side with David, not Goliath. All our heroes are plucky underdogs: Robin Hood, Dick Whittington, Oliver Twist. Trump is neither plucky, nor an underdog. He is the exact opposite of that. He's not even a spoiled rich-boy, or a greedy fat-cat. He's more a fat white slug. A Jabba the Hutt of privilege.

And worse, he is that most unforgivable of all things to the British: a bully. That is, except when he is among bullies; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling sidekick instead.

There are unspoken rules to this stuff – the Queensberry rules of basic decency – and he breaks them all. He punches downwards – which a gentleman should, would, could never do – and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless or female – and he kicks them when they are down. So the fact that a significant minority – perhaps a third – of Americans look at what he does, listen to what he says, and then think 'Yeah, he seems like my kind of guy' is a matter of some confusion and no little distress to British people, given that:

- Americans are supposed to be nicer than us, and most are.
=You don't need a particularly keen eye for detail to spot a few flaws in the man.

This last point is what especially confuses and dismays British people, and many other people too; his faults seem pretty bloody hard to miss.

After all, it's impossible to read a single tweet, or hear him speak a sentence or two, without staring deep into the abyss. He turns being artless into an art form; he is a Picasso of pettiness; a Shakespeare of shit. His faults are fractal: even his flaws have flaws, and so on ad infinitum. God knows there have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid. He makes Nixon look trustworthy and George W look smart. In fact, if Frankenstein decided to make a monster assembled entirely from human flaws – he would make a Trump.",1,1587356593

He cannot technically force a State to open against the wish of the Governor, but he can arrest the Governor for willfully creating an order which limits US Constitutional rights of unmolested travel, unabridged public assembly, or individual due process prior to denial of access to personal property or civil confinement of that individual. At the point that the President provides permission and assistance, as he has now, it is Constitutional, but before, when he had not given explicit permission or assistance to State lockdowns, he could have arrested essentially every Governor in the nation for willfully violating the United States Constitution. I would imagine his campaign and other advisers strongly recommended against it, as it would be political suicide, but when we are considering authority and legality, he had the authority and it would have been legal. In the end, it would have the result of forcing States to open, especially accompanied by the warning to all police forces nationwide that enforcing an unconstitutional State order may land them time in Federal prison. No cop wants to risk prison, cops don't survive prison. All State order enforcement would have ceased immediately, and completely legally.

1135,trump,"I am willing to buy the premise, but I have heard it repeated without any actual details. As far as I know, China didn't even report this to WHO until December, so I'm unsure if November is your exaggeration or not. What is it that Trump could have done to prepare the nation in a 75 day time period, which he did not do? 

Put another way, Obama dealt with a pandemic with alarming warnings in 2009. If we are just basing this on, Trump got alarming warnings and did not do something he should have, I presume this is something Obama did do back in 2009, right? In retrospect, 2009 was not a big thing, but, hindsight is 20/20. At the time, Obama received alarming warnings of a growing pandemic, and, what are the actions he took back then which Trump did not take now? 

I am not implying there are none, I am curious if you have a strong argument or are just repeating things people on TV said.",1,1587392549

&gt; It’s rare for a professor to disparage the intelligence of a student, but according to attorney Frank DiPrima, who was close friends with professor William T. Kelley for 47 years, the prof made an exception for Donald Trump, at least in private. 

&gt; “He must have told me that 100 times over the course of 30 years,” says DiPrima, who has been practicing law since 1963 and has served as in-house counsel for entities including the Federal Trade Commission and Playboy Enterprises. 

&gt; “I remember the inflection of his voice when he said it: ‘Donald Trump was the **dumbest goddamn** student I **ever** had!'” 

&gt; He would say that [Trump] came to Wharton thinking he already knew everything, that he was arrogant and he wasn’t there to learn.” 

&gt; Kelley, who passed away in 2011 at age 94, taught marketing at Wharton for 31 years, retiring in 1982.

I did my best to find the least bias source for that, but you can look it up for yourself.

The fact that he managed to run through most of Fred Trump's $400 million fortune by the time his father passed away, and then had to resort to *The Apprentice* and laundering money through his real estate holdings for Russian oligarchs in the late '90's and early '00's to regain some solvency speaks pretty clearly, as well.

Joe Biden is an enormously unappealing candidate for so many reasons.

It's very likely that he's even a bad person who wouldn't be welcome in my home. But he's objectively the lesser of two evils. I know it's getting popular to refuse to choose the lesser of two evils. I understand. But when presented, as we are, the stark choice between two evils, it is incumbent on any moral person to choose the lesser evil rather than, by inaction or wasted action, allow the greater to prevail.

With Amazon perhaps seeking to bypass USPS, the agency  must be careful not to price itself out of the market — and thus face a  bigger financial squeeze. Moreover, under the law, USPS is prohibited  from losing money in the package-delivery sector.

What does it even have to do with what I wrote?

Also, the American system is busted, because you give too much leeway to corporations and capital-owners. They have no accountability whatsoever. And less regulations will not make things any better, quite the contrary, but lawmakers actually have to think before writing and voting the bills

This might be why things are so effed up, because you have a bunch of morons in Washington DC, who are either christian- or capitalist fundamentalist, who have abdicated any independent thought. Corporate ghouls have taken over both parties. Ain't you happy?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Some countries, like Sweden, went with a herd immunity strategy and their infection rates are comparable so far.

No, that's bullshit. [They have nearly ten times more deaths than their immediate neighbors](https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/how-sweden-and-norway-handled-coronavirus-differently-2020-4).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Some studies already suggest that as many as 50 to 80 times more people  may be infected with A-symptomatic variants, which puts the infection in  the multi-million range.

Yes, and? What is your point? That the threat is overblown? Would be funny if the health systems were not overtaxed and this whole thing was not costing people their lives.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If the world economy spins into a depression for a decade causing  untold suffering for millions and you supported it because you were too  willing to believe.

Ah, there we go. The rallying cry of ""but the economy..."" Should have thought about that before destroying social security nets. Sure, it will have an impact. Hundreds of thousands of people dying would, too.

If you do take a look at Sweden, they did not react quickly, and now they have significantly more dead people than others. The dead do not buy anything. They do not participate in the economy. What would be the most damaging? If you do not close down more people will die AND the economy will tank because people are dying. If you do close down, less people will die, the economy will tank, but at least these people will be there to rebuild.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And remember, the WHO said there was no human to human transfer of the virus

[They reported what the Chinese authorities told them](https://nypost.com/2020/03/20/who-haunted-by-old-tweet-saying-china-found-no-human-transmission-of-coronavirus/). Which contradicted what the [WHO itself had already said a few days prior.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/who-cited-human-transmission-risk-in-january-despite-trump-claims)

I fully agree that they should not have been so gullible, though, but China has already too much influence in the WHO. They are paying the bills, after all. How do you think things will go, now that the USA have completely pulled financing?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Still going with their experts and the media figures that dutifully parroted their advice?

So, if you do not trust the experts, I trust you are now currently volunteering in a hospital and forfeiting any protection, right? And if you do catch it, I am sure [Kenneth Copeland will be more than happy to blow on yo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMkyDS5ULts)u to chase it away, or you could try [Madagascar's President's herbal tea, which he promises cures the disease](https://ewn.co.za/2020/04/21/madagascar-president-launches-coronavirus-remedy).

Both of these idiots are not experts, so I am sure you will trust them, then.

Hospitals say feds are seizing masks and other coronavirus supplies without a word. [(1)](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-04-07/hospitals-washington-seize-coronavirus-supplies)

This is in addition to the feds stealing supplies from shipments from states, and acts of piracy abroad. [(2)](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-52161995)

# **Here's how what they're doing works:**

1.) Eliminate oversight of the spending of nearly a trillion dollars of tax dollars. [(3)](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/490737-stimulus-opens-new-front-in-trumps-oversight-fight)

2.) Acquire the authority to command which businesses get which contracts. [(4)](https://youtu.be/MlQx7Qs2ACI)

3.) Have trusted people stand up companies through which the money can be funneled (3 week old company, founded through a loan approved via the Coronavirus Stimulus bill, is now the center of medical supply distribution): [(5)](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/27/republican-fundraiser-company-coronavirus-152184) “I don’t want to overstate, but we probably represent the largest global supply chain for Covid-19 supplies right now,” he said. “We are getting ready to fill 100 million-unit mask orders.” [(16)](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/27/republican-fundraiser-company-coronavirus-152184)

4.) Have the federal government sell, at a reduced price, its strategic stockpile to the new companies, run by your buddies. [(6)](https://twitter.com/DavidBegnaud/status/12458414583237713933) [(15)](https://twitter.com/DavidBegnaud/status/1245841458323771393)

States are having to smuggle in supplies [(17)](https://www.salon.com/2020/04/21/states-smuggle-covid-19-medical-supplies-to-avoid-federal-seizures-as-house-probes-jared-kushner/) aboard sports teams jets (among other methods), and escort them with state police [(10)](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/a-million-n95-masks-are-coming-from-chinaon-board-the-new-england-patriots-plane-11585821600). Is it really to this point that we're going to have to have states deploy the national guard to protect their shipments and supplies and treat the federal government like the enemy?

This is no different from the Somalian government stealing food sent by the United Nations and cartels selling it illegally. [(11)](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/10/aid-somalia-stolen-un-report)

Except in this situation FEMA is the cartels and the banana republic is the United States.

Also regarding Trump removing the watchdog overseeing the $2 trillion coronavirus bill? In 1998 the Supreme Court ruled line item vetos are unconstitutional. [(12)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_v._City_of_New_York)

His excuse? The Take Care Clause. And the Take Care Clause just says the President can't make his underlings do stuff that's against the law. It underscores that the executive is under a duty to faithfully execute the laws of Congress and not disregard them. [(13)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution)

If you don't know what that's about, Trump wrote a signing statement (basically functionally a line item veto except the next President could undo it, but by then it'd be too late) into the stimulus bill that he was going to ignore the oversight provisions in the bill and do it himself. [(14)](https://www.motherjones.com/coronavirus-updates/2020/03/trump-says-hell-ignore-key-oversight-provision-in-stimulus-bill-1/) Either way, the Take Care Clause makes it illegal. 

According to Bradley and Posner, since the president is actually obligated under the “Take Care Clause” to comply with the constitution, “if the president believes that a statute violates the constitution, he has a constitutional obligation not to enforce it” (Bradley and Posner: 358).[(16)](https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1411&amp;context=etd) The opposite also holds true (see citation 13).",1,1588061168
1251,trump,"It's amazing how you know all this but don't seem to be aware of how heavily taxpayer-funded research programs underpin all that ""private"" research that led to ""new"" inventions, which were then patented by corporations.

Corporations exist solely for the benefit their owners, boards, and stockholders. They don't exist to benefit the rest of society, and yet they depend on the taxes their own workforce and the rest of us pay to provide them with the infrastructure to peacefully create, market, and move their product across country and around the world. 

It's obscene that companies like McDonalds and WalMart direct their employees to social assistance programs rather than pay them a living wage. WalMart wouldn't even exist if it hadn't taken advantage of the US corporations outsourcing their products from China--a heavily-regulated economy--and undercutting domestic manufacturing. You might not be old enough to remember the economy previously, but I am.

I'm of the opinion that Citizens United was the worst Supreme Court decision ever. Political campaigns should be run on an even playing field. 

Dark money has been pumped into political campaigns from all around the world ever since, and if that hadn't happened, Donald Trump would not be IMPOTUS, and a billionaire would not have been able to buy his way onto the last Dem debate stage.",1,1588063710

Companies exist to make product for the customer.  Corporations are a legal entity designed to shield the rich from their company's mistakes.  I would revise the system, either make the corporations so responsive to the customers' needs they wouldn't just gobble up holdings or eliminate the corporations in favor of individual owners that would have a vested interest in keep the company's products safe.

Minimum wage is another boondoggle.  You want to completely roboticize McDonald's, keep pushing for it.  As for goods from China, yeah, those chickens are coming home to roost.  We never should've started down that road, but it looks like the administration is looking to pull out.

1257,trump,"""And just who do you think would declare the emergency? Oh, right, the State, because private actors would be able to abuse it if they were the lone authority for this...""

Not exactly sure why you're arguing this point or why it even matters to you in this context, but if you have a landlord, you don't own where you live and there are a variety of ways you can get kicked out.

""...Europe is getting more than double the number of immigrants than the USA. So, which is the more attractive, then?""

​And how's that working out?  BTW, you're physically closer to the war torn areas courtesy of the Western powers.  Thankfully, Trump doesn't seem interested in ginning up further conflict.

But in the US, our immigrants tend to integrate because we are a large country with vast lands.  Unfortunately for Europe, not the case and you have pockets of problems because when immigrants don't integrate, you're going to have problems.  No one but lunatics are AGAINST immigration, you just have too much.  But hey, it's your country.  If you think you can screen tens of thousands of people for COVID effectively, support them with taxpayer money and give them free healthcare, go for it.  We've done the math in the U.S.  Newsflash, you can't and neither can we.  And we have way more money.

""I am pretty sure you will balk at giving the State that much control (with, I would agree, some good reasons).""

Yeah, fuck that and fuck the WHO and the Marxist prick they put in charge.  The guy denied a cholera outbreak in his own country while people died.

""By the way, corporatists have been at the helm for decades in the USA, given the current shitshow, would you consider ousting them?""

It's not the way it works here.  Yeah, we got our share of corporatists, but it's a battle between them, the old rich, the new rich, the famous and on and on.  There's a lot of people in the mix.  No one group or person can be in charge.  That's why there's a bit of chaos, because there needs to be.  Centralize things too much and you get the EU.

""For once, governments are doing what they were built for: supporting citizens.""

Hahahahaha!  Wow.  Have you EVER read a history book?

""Cool. As I have said, why don't you volunteer in a local hospital without protective gear?""

Unlike you, I'm not gung-ho to save the world until I get my own house in order.  Something you ought to consider before dragging your fellow citizens and forcing them to pay for programs they don't like, don't use and/or don't work.

1258,trump,"&gt;   but if you have a landlord, you don't own where you live and there are a variety of ways you can get kicked out. 

I still do not see what this has to do with the pandemic and the fact that private persons cannot mandate a number of things. As for evicting people, in Europe, you have to get a court order, a landlord cannot evict unilaterally. Might be something to consider...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Thankfully, Trump doesn't seem interested in ginning up further conflict

You seem to have missed the crap he is pulling on Iran.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Centralize things too much and you get the EU. 

Meaning? I am genuinely curious, here, because the EU is anything but centralised. The EU institutions have in fact very limited power, much less than the US federal government.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Hahahahaha!  Wow.  Have you EVER read a history book?

1269,trump,"&gt; Sure, and I am certain the crooks will voluntarily stop being arseholes and crooks. We have laws and a justice system because humans cannot help but consistently be arseholes to each others.
&gt; 
&gt; What you advocate is the freedom of the fox in a free henhouse. You defend the freedom of the fox to eat its fill but do not care about the chicken.

You conflate laws that people 100% agree (against murder, theft and private property) with regulation of individual industries.  A couple of years ago, Congress decided to ""regulate"" the milk industry.  Even though humans have been drinking raw milk for thousands of years, Congress decided to outlaw it, driving local diary farms out of business.  This was the result of the pressure of big diary wanting to take over those farms and drive that competition out.  They did it under the guise of protecting people who shouldn't drink raw milk.  That's what you get with regulation.  More expensive and less competition.

There is already a system in place if you get sick from drinking raw milk.  You can sue the person that sold you the milk.  If a court decides you deserve money, they'll give it to you.  And if it happens enough, that diary will either change it's ways or go out of business.  That's the system.

""Do you listen to the guy who wants to spread a disease or the ones who do not want to get contaminated?""

So you believe the protesters WANT to spread disease?  That's their goal?  And you believe that the politicians ONLY want to help people not get contaminated?  You believed that when Trump began the shutdown?  So you believed that about Trump?

""That came afterwards. They have nothing coherent to propose as concrete measures. It is a hodgepodge of left, far-left and far-right ideas, with narry any inkling of what to do to make it applicable and sustainable.""

A distinction without a difference.  They're the ones protesting and it seems to be a pretty popular protest to last over a year.

""What the fuck...""

Ooo, dude.  Roll it back.  The first gun control in the U.S. was passed to keep ex-slaves from getting guns, so...  Again, learn your history.  You're going back in time before the Republicans even existed.  You know they freed the slaves, right?  Political parties shift back and forth.  It's a chaotic mess here sometimes.

""I am criticising European governments all I want.""

Try criticizing certain religions all you want.  I hear there's one where people get flagged and arrested.  And then there's the Left's current definition of what a woman and a man is.  Also a hot topic where the cops show up to arrest you over Facebook posts.  We don't have that here...yet.

Wow, you must assume every American is a racist just because we can say naughty words!  You'll be happy to know (I guess) that there are many woke people working to get laws on the books to outlaw certain speech.  It never stops at one word or one group of words.

For a while, for instance, during the height of Black Lives Matter, there was a group of cops and cop families that started Blue Lives Matter.  Basically the same thing, but for cops.  What you probably don't know is that police unions in the U.S. are insanely powerful entities with great political power.  It's hard for a politician to get elected if you don't get the local police union to support you in certain areas of the country, especially Democratically controlled urban areas.

Anyway, they weren't content with awesome pensions, benefits, overtime, regular pay and a judicial system that almost never punishes cops that routinely break the law, so they started a political movement to get the same status for a cop attack as a hate crime.  And they wanted criticism to be also classified that way.  That's what you get without freedom of speech.  You ban some speech for certain groups and then every group under the sun with a little pull is going to line up and get the same thing.  Say the n-word, go to jail.  Tell a cop to f-off, go to jail.  That's where censorship is already heading in the UK.

""You fear your government so much that you have made bed with corporations...""

Actually, we have plenty of influence over corporations in industries where there is competition.  We're customers and they want to please us.  The problems comes from industries that no long see their customers or have been insulated (usually through regulation) from consequences.

The roll of government is to keep the playing field level and encourage competition.  Once they start regulating the individual industries, those industries must get in on the regulations or their competitors will.  Keep Congress out of regulation and those corporations can't use the government as a stick to beat people with.  Pretty simple concept.",1,1588178530

---

Almost a decade has passed since I published a column, “Myths of Austerity,” warning that deficit alarmism would delay recovery from the Great Recession — which it did. Unfortunately, that kind of alarmism seems to be making a comeback.

You can see that comeback in the gradually increasing number of news analyses emphasizing how much debt we’ll run up dealing with the Covid-19 crisis. You can also see it in the rhetoric of politicians like Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, who is blocking aid to beleaguered state and local governments because, he says, it would cost too much.

So this seems like a good time to emphasize two key facts. One is economic: While we will run very big budget deficits over the next couple of years, they will do little if any harm. The other is that whatever they may say, very few prominent figures in politics or the media are genuine deficit hawks, who are actually worried about the consequences of rising government debt. What we mainly have, instead, are deficit peacocks and deficit vultures.

The term “deficit peacocks” was coined by the Center for American Progress for people who preen and posture about fighting deficits without offering realistic policy proposals. I’d broaden the term to include what I used to call Very Serious People — those who inveigh against the evils of debt not because they’ve done a careful analysis but because they imagine that it makes them sound earnest and tough-minded.

The glory days of deficit peacocks were the early teens, an era in which people like Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles were lionized by the news media. As Vox’s Ezra Klein noted at the time, for some reason “the usual rules of reportorial neutrality don’t apply when it comes to the deficit”; the wisdom and virtue of deficit warriors were simply taken for granted.

We haven’t heard much from the deficit peacocks in recent years, even though the budget deficit, which declined sharply during the Obama years, soared again under Donald Trump. Funny how that works. But you can be sure they’ll be back in force if Joe Biden wins this November.

What about deficit vultures? That’s the term I’ve been using for politicians who exploit real or imagined fiscal distress to feed a reactionary policy agenda.

After the last crisis, conservatives used deficits as an excuse to cut social programs — for example, a number of states made it much harder to collect unemployment benefits. This time around, McConnell and Trump are trying to exploit deficit fears to force state governments to downsize, undermine (and possibly privatize) the post office and more.

It goes almost without saying that the deficit vultures are hypocrites. After all, Trump and McConnell rammed through a $2 trillion tax cut in 2017, with no apparent concern about the effects on the deficit. Nor have I heard any Republican complaints about Trump’s huge bailouts for farmers, whose distress is largely the result of his own policies.

An aside: Far too much reporting on these issues involves what the economist Dean Baker calls mind-reading. That is, news analyses include statements along the lines of “Republicans are concerned about rising deficits,” when in fact all we know is that Republicans claim to be concerned about rising deficits — and there are very good reasons to be skeptical about that claim. After all, have modern Republicans ever seen deficits as a constraint on their own tax-cutting agenda? Even once?

Still, hypocrisy aside, should we be worried about the effects of Covid-19 on debt? No.

It’s true that we’re headed for some eye-popping numbers. Last week the Congressional Budget Office released preliminary economic and budget projections for the next two years, which were both shocking and unsurprising.

That is, the numbers were grim but more or less in line with what many independent economists have been predicting. In particular, the budget office expects the Covid-19 crisis to drive the unemployment rate to 16 percent in a few months, which might even be on the low side.

Soaring unemployment will cause federal revenues to plunge, and also lead to a surge in spending on safety-net programs like unemployment insurance, Medicaid and food stamps. Add in the large relief packages Congress has passed, and the budget office projects a deficit that will temporarily rise to levels we haven’t seen since World War II, and it expects federal debt to rise to 108 percent from 79 percent of G.D.P., which sounds scary.

But the government will be able to borrow that money at incredibly low interest rates. In fact, real interest rates — rates on government bonds protected against inflation — are negative. So the burden of the additional debt as measured by the rise in federal interest payments will be negligible. And no, we don’t have to worry about paying off the debt; we never will, and that’s OK.

The bottom line is that right now, the only thing we have to fear from deficits is deficit fear itself. Pay no attention to the peacocks and vultures: In this time of pandemic, we can and should spend whatever it takes to limit the damage.",1,1588188873
1274,trump,"Trump's allergic to intelligence, in all senses of *intelligence*.

This is a golden opportunity for a President *willing to do the work* to ensure his reelection as well as his place in history as one of the US's better Presidents. Sadly, as much as Trump avoids intelligence, he goes much farther to avoid effort.

What we have at the moment is a President who comes out top of the lists for self-interestedness, sociopathy, intellectual laziness, inability to learn from mistakes because he's incapable of admitting them (sole exception: in the wake of airing what he said on the Access Hollywood tape, his campaign staff convinced him **temporarily** that he needed to issue an insincere apology).

1276,trump,"&gt; You conflate laws that people 100% agree (against murder, theft and private property) with regulation of individual industries. 

I am quite certain fraudsters do not agree with the laws criminalising fraud. Hel, if they are successful enough, they can even get them repelled (Wall Street and banks bribing politicians to let them abuse the system is a given, at this point.).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; There is already a system in place if you get sick from drinking raw  milk.  You can sue the person that sold you the milk.  If a court  decides you deserve money, they'll give it to you.  And if it happens  enough, that diary will either change it's ways or go out of business.   That's the system. 

Fat lot of good that does you if you are dead or crippled, which is what you risk when drinking raw milk. I love how you defend the system when the system defends laisser-faire, but reject it when the system tries to preemptively solve the issue.

Now, I agree that public authorities can be instrumentalised by private interests. My take on this is that you should make your public authorities independent from that sort of influence. Get money out of politics. Have a fair system of elections and you might see some improvement.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; So you believe the protesters WANT to spread disease?  That's their  goal?  And you believe that the politicians ONLY want to help people not  get contaminated?  You believed that when Trump began the shutdown?  So  you believed that about Trump? 

Intention, perhaps not, but it will certainly be a consequence. [Evangelists have flaunted lockdown and whaddayaknow, members of their community are getting infected](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/liberty-university-coronavirus-student-positive-jerry-falwell-jr). Libertarians and the religious right are always talking about personal reponsibility. Well, this is it. They fucked up. Now, they need to be sued out of existence. But unfortunately, when they talk about personal responsibility, they only talk about other people...

As for politicians, they are vying for reelection. Does not mean it was not the right thing to do. I will trust a wide majority of doctors when they tell me that this is the best medical advice, over kooks and grifters.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Ooo, dude.  Roll it back.  The first gun control in the U.S. was passed  to keep ex-slaves from getting guns, so...  Again, learn your history.   You're going back in time before the Republicans even existed.  You know  they freed the slaves, right?  Political parties shift back and forth.   It's a chaotic mess here sometimes. 

Nice deflection. You do not address my point. The Second amendment is a failure, because citizens have never in the history of the USA taken up arms to put a check on their government. However, they have gleefully taken up their arms to oppress the downtrodden some more.

The Second amendment is the perfect example of a regulation with more drawbacks (35 000 dead per year) than advantages (maybe self-defense, but if that were the case, the NRA would be shouting the numbers from the rooftops. Since they are not, I will argue that the effect is in fact negligible.). By the way, I can still have a firearm in most of Europe. I will simply have to prove that I am not a felon and I will have to get a permit if I want to carry it around. Same as getting a driving licence: prove you know how to use it before putting a dangerous tool in some idiot's hands.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Try criticizing certain religions all you want.  I hear there's one where people get flagged and arrested. 

Sift through my posting history. You will find me quite active on the atheism sub, where I have criticised just about every religion (with maybe the exception of the Flying Spaghetti Monster and Jainism, but that's about it...). Still here, still criticising Islam, judaism and christianity, since they are responsible for most of the religious conflict in the Western world.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; And then there's the Left's current definition of what a woman and a man  is.  Also a hot topic where the cops show up to arrest you over  Facebook posts.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Wow, you must assume every American is a racist just because we can say naughty words! 

No, I assume people are racist when they throw a fit about not being able to say the n-word all they want.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Actually, we have plenty of influence over corporations in industries  where there is competition.  We're customers and they want to please us.   The problems comes from industries that no long see their customers or  have been insulated (usually through regulation) from consequences. 

That is the theory. In practice, it is much less clear. De facto monopolies or oligopoles are rampant. Did Amazon achieve its monopoly by being protected by regulations? Did Microsoft achieve its dominant position by leaving competition alone? The main thing restricting their power is, in fact, regulations. When the Court of Justice of the EU fines Microsoft for abusing its dominant position, you should rather be thankful. The idea that competition is sustainable is a pipedream, once you go above a certain size. There will be acquisitions, mergers, consolidation and soon enough, you have at best few at worst only one enterprise controlling the whole market, directly or through branches.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Keep Congress out of regulation and those corporations can't use the  government as a stick to beat people with.  Pretty simple concept. 

I would argue that the exact opposite should be done: keep corporations out of Congress. Fire any politician with a conflict of interest. Regulations are in fact necessary and should be done for the common good, not the good of any given corporation.",1,1588227502
1277,trump,"""I am quite certain fraudsters do not agree with the laws criminalising fraud""

Oh, I disagree.  Show me the fraudster that's cool with being defrauded from his own money.

""Fat lot of good that does you if you are dead or crippled, which is what you risk when drinking raw milk.""

From the FDA's own site:  ""According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), from 1993 through 2012, there were 127 outbreaks linked to raw milk or raw milk products like ice cream, soft cheese, or yogurt. They resulted in 1,909 illnesses and 144 hospitalizations.""
https://www.fda.gov/food/buy-store-serve-safe-food/dangers-raw-milk-unpasteurized-milk-can-pose-serious-health-risk

144 hospitalizations in 19 years.  Less than eight a year and two deaths.  Only 3.4% of the population even drinks it.  That's still around eleven million people.  Out of that many people, 2 deaths, 8 hospitalizations a year over almost 20 years.  For that, you want to destroy local diary farmers who sell to a very TINY silver of the population.  You want to hand TOTAL CONTROL of diary to large corporations.

What happened to the Socialist I was arguing with?

Get money out of politics?  I already explained to do that!  If Congress can't regulate industry, there'd be no reason to bribe them!  And understand, again, I'm talking regulation.  If someone puts the word ""milk"" on something that's poisonous, we can all agree that's a crime.  Now, with the money out of politics, you could remove caps on suing businesses because THAT IS something the government (through the legislative and judicial branch) controls.  But corporations would find it MUCH HARDER to bribe members of Congress since that law could also apply to THEM or competing interests.

But it starts by admitting that the government can't be your daddy and mommy.  That's not what they're for.  They're there to enforce the rules we ALL agreed to, not some industry trying to stiff its competitors.

""Intention, perhaps not,...""

Well, first off, you're ignoring the Constitutional issues.  People are already attempting to exploit this tragedy both politically and economically.  Imagine if Trump had made the lockdown federal, then extended it in certain areas of the country in order to impact the election in November.  Somehow, I think it would be the OTHER side of the aisle protesting because it would jibe with THEIR political sensibilities.

The dynamics in the U.S. work like this:  If a Democrat does something to support the Constitution, our media calls it stunning and brave.  If a Republican does something, it's ignorant and probably racist.

Libertarians say, yes, those people should suffer the consequences of their actions.  Unfortunately, people on the Left and people like yourself have lobbied for laws that cover EVERYONE all the time.  For instance, hospitals here, by law, HAVE to treat you under most circumstances.  If hospitals were competitive, private entities (making them so cheap, it would greatly lower the cost of healthcare) you'd also have to give them the ability to turn people away at the door.  THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY WOULD, but they could if, for instance, the people who got sick were the same people who blocked the entrances to the hospital during a pandemic.  But our left-leaning politicians and media would squeal and demand treatment for the same poor and ignorant dopes.

You can't have it both ways.  You can't blame people who want personal responsibility and fight for it in a risky way and then turn around and say ""I'm mad you people are taking risks!""  They want to take the risks, for THIS.  You think it's dumb.  You're entitled to your opinion, but understand the down-the-stream effects of your policies because I assure you, these people understand theirs because they WANT to be self-sufficient. 

""Nice deflection...""  

It's happened on a small scale and sometimes it's moved the needle.  In general, it keeps the government in the check because no sensible person would attempt to take over this country because it's impossible.  Everyone here is armed.  But hey, if you want to continue to live in blissful ignorance of the dangers of the world and walk around unarmed, that's your call.

As for the facts your citing about guns, I REALLY don't feel going through the arduous process of telling you how wrong you are.  Just remember how hard you fought for the right to be unarmed if you ever hear some shots and realize you're in trouble.  Or maybe some time in the not-too-distant future when your government pushes you around.

""Did Amazon achieve its monopoly by being protected by regulations?""

They were first in what they did and, quite frankly, they're good at it.  They're main competitor was really ebay and ebay did get screwed by government regulation forcing taxes on shipped goods.  Something Amazon pushed for, I believe.  One or both companies pushed for an Internet Sales Tax to squash the smaller competitors, but it failed.  A handful still exist.  They haven't found a market yet, but Amazon will eventually become bloated, ineffectual, expensive, etc.  Then someone will use that to get into the market.  Might be new tech, like a faster drone.  The whole drone thing's complicated.  Various laws.  Not totally up on it.  But that's the pattern of these things.  Companies come and go, unless the government bails them out.

You're not making a very strong point here.  All the companies in the U.S. have leaned on Congress to get laws passed to screw their competition.  Including Microsoft back in the day, along with the lawsuits.

""Fire any politician with a conflict of interest.""

How?  Who makes the call?  Under our system (depending on the state) there would have to be a recall election or an election.  Or he'd have to go to jail, which has happened.  

""Regulations are in fact necessary and should be done for the common good, not the good of any given corporation.""

What they should be and do is not a fact.  IT'S YOUR WISH.  I choose not to live in fantasyland.  The problem is, as the Founders knew, if men were angels there would be no need for laws.  There are no men angelic enough to decide ""Well THAT guy is bad and that regulation is bad!""  The whole thing is a negotiation that mitigates the damage.  You'll never eliminate it.  You need a system that BROADLY works.  Not a system where you micromanage everything or you hand centralized control to a handful of bureaucrats that end up becoming corporate puppets.

They definitely would turn them back. Hel, that is what private practices do in Europe, sending people to the hospital, when they do not make enough of a profit on a medical act or when they know the person does not have the means to pay.

As for being cheaper, please. The USA pay through the nose for their heavily privatised healthcare, way more than any other country in the industrialised world. and before you go on harping about how you get superior healthcare, Americans die younger than Europeans. If your healthcare was so much better, this would be the opposite. Meanwhile, Europeans smoke (way) more than Americans, we also have an overweight crisis in a number of countries. Americans do have some risk factors, but so do Europeans. And yet, Europeans live consistently older than Americans, with their supposedly superior healthcare.

We have pushed our government around multiple times (1789, 1848, 1871, 1958, 1968, 1995...). When have Americans? The only successful example I can find is the protests against the Vietnam, which were surprisingly devoid of any gun...

&gt;  Companies come and go, unless the government bails them out. 

No. Above a certain size, they may change names, but they endure. All the big corporations in America (with the exception of the last tech boom, by simple virtue of chronology...) are decades if not centuries old. Same in Europe. Not all of them have been bailed out or propped up by governments. Krupps, Schneider, Bayer, Dupont de Nemours, Lafarge, L'Oréal, Arcelor, Renault, etc...

The organisation itself simply becomes too diversified to really fold, once it gets past a certain threshold.

As if you had any chance against a multi-billion dollars company. Hel, even on the off-chance you can get damages, it will be a pithy compared to the profits they have made poisoning you (tobacco manufacturers, for example). Do you really think they will change their practices when they make much more money ignoring the risks? The bloody fossil fuel industries have sat on their own research showing that climate change would jeopardise human civilisation. They do not think in terms of accountability, because it is never personal accountability, it is simply the cost of doing business. Meanwhile, people are dying.

""The USA pay through the nose for their heavily privatised healthcare...""

Heavily REGULATED private healthcare.  Goes back to the 70's with Nixon creating HMO's.  Prior to that, we didn't have too many problems getting people healthcare.  Before that, it was the AMA that ruined it for workers.  We used to have these things called MEDICAL LODGES.  

In the early 1900's, coal miners and the like would pool their money, create a contract for a doctor and that doctor would agree to treat everyone in the pool for a year.  These were very lucrative contracts and the workers got great care for the price of...one week's pay.  For a whole year!

But the lucrative contracts were so coveted, doctors began to compete for them.  But the richer doctors saw prices go down and some of them were making less money because of it.  Plus they didn't like the idea of a bunch of coal miners hanging a contract out for these educated doctors.  So the rich doctors, using their connections in government, created the AMA.  One of the first things the AMA did was outlaw lodges by making it so you couldn't be a licensed doctor if you worked for one of the lodges.  Again, that's the government interfering in the market again.

""Remember...""

Jesus, dude.  I didn't realize this was a dick measuring contest for revolutions.  Let's see, it starts with things like the Whiskey Rebellion during Washington's time.  Virtually every time after a war, the vets ending up protesting, shanty towns post WW1, Vietnam before and after, there were protests during W, until Obama, plus Occupy Wall Street and now we have antifa.  And then, of course, there were these little protests you may not have heard about called the Civil Rights Movement and the Civil War?!

""And so, what is your solution? Remove any and all regulation?""

Most of it.  But we also need a more robust civil court.  It's not bad, but needs some work.  Mostly we need to unburden the court system with pointless criminal complaints and things like family court.  It's a mess thanks to lawyers groups.  It's complicated, but something the government can and should sort out.

""Adapt your system, then. Make your politicians accountable before the population....""

They are.  They're called elections.  What you're talking about is adding a level of bureaucrats that are appointed to oversee THEM.  No thanks.  Not feasible or smart.  Those experts are just as vulnerable to the same excesses.  Experts are for consulting, not leading.  (See the AMA for what happens when the experts make the decisions about their field.)  Politicians have to look at the big picture.  A guy like Dr. Faulci might say close the country down for another month, but leaders have to create a balance.

""I am a bureaucrat. So are my colleagues. None of us take our orders from corporations. If you want to find who is skewing the balance, follow the money. Chances are, somebody is getting some campaign contribution or some such, and it ain't a bureaucrat.""

Well, that explains a lot.  Then you understand that you're not incentivized to be efficient or compassionate or even smart.  In the US, everyone must spend their budget by the end of the year, if you don't your budget is cut, therefore they always waste lots of extra money because that's the only way to increase your budget.  

Trump has been a Democrat his entire life.  He supported the Clintons and gave them money.  Everyone calls him such a liar until you point this out, but NOW he's suddenly telling the truth.  

If you believe our squealing press, he sure sounds like the next coming of Hitler.  He's not.  In fact, so far, he's killed the least amount of people overseas than any president in a while.

1281,trump,"Both parties do.  But if you think they're stupid now, you should read about the history of political parties.  Basically they came about because the Constitution had no plan for how political nominees are chosen.  They just hand picked the nominees *and* pretty much decided themselves who the President would be because 99% of the population didn't give a shit about politics until the 1820's and thus didn't vote.  Voter turnout was usually around 5% even in states with popular votes for electors.  People just wanted the elites to choose and to leave them alone because the only politically divisive issue of the time was between Federalists and Anti-Federalists, and that was only argued among the ruling class.  
  
It wasn't until the Civil War that average people had a reason to choose sides.  And even through Reconstruction voters just didn't give a shit about choosing nominees.  They only cared about choosing the winner of the general election; the party mattered more than the person.  It wasn't until the 1900's that people even participated in any kind of primary process.  And still the nominee was pretty much decided exclusively by king-makers behind closed doors.  The idea was that charismatic zealots might secure a party's nomination if people were left to freely vote without the upper class overruling them.  
  
The point when people even remotely influenced the outcome of a primary wasn't until the 1970s.  Both parties finally started implementing more Democratic processes for selecting a nominee, but it wasn't until the 1990s that we got anything resembling what we have today.  Republicans gave up more control than Democrats.  Democrats maintained a thumb on the scale with superdelegates.  They're weaker than ever now but still there.  This was due to the old fear of a charlatan managing to appeal to voters enough to highjack a party away from its core values.  Republicans didn't maintain nearly as strong a control on their primaries, seeking to appear as a more democratic party that truly reflected the will of it's constituents.  
  
I suppose it's ironic then that Donald Trump may have proven the elitists right in the end.  The whole reason for all the machinations of parties overruling voters from the Civil War to the 1980s was based on the premise that we'd elect a maniac and couldn't be trusted.  Republicans relented and finally let the people decide, and two decades later look where we are.  
  
Just remember that political parties aren't legally part of the democratic process.  They're private clubs who chose people to throw their hat in the ring for office.  Our Constitution still considers only the general elections to be actual elections; it doesn't recognize the process of choosing nominees as integral to democracy.  It doesn't recognize the process at all in fact.  It's like it didn't exist because for the framers, it didn't.  Washington was the *de facto* nominee before the first letter of the document was written.  They didn't give a single thought about what to do after him.",3,1588275302

I guess we have a very different view on what qualifies as regulated markets. A public healthcare system is regulated, for Europeans. The free-for-all health insurance market of the USA is not.

Seriously, though, Thanks for the information on the evolutionof your healthcare system. That is an interesting read.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Again, that's the government interfering in the market again. 

It is private actors interfering with government, to interfere on their behalf in the market. I see no issue with government interfering in the market for public interests' reasons. I do take issue with the government skewing the balance, though, for no other reason than some politicians getting bribed.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I didn't realize this was a dick measuring contest for revolutions. \[...\]

And as far as I can see, all those you cited validate my point: firearms were not used to effect change, I would even argue that using firearms would have set back the movement.

As for the Civil War, a bunch of traitors decided they preferred their slaves to the USA. And to this day, you still treat their followers with kid gloves. We slaughtered nazi collaborators. You erect statues to slavers...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Most of it.  But we also need a more robust civil court.  It's not bad,  but needs some work.  Mostly we need to unburden the court system with  pointless criminal complaints and things like family court.  It's a mess  thanks to lawyers groups.  It's complicated, but something the  government can and should sort out. 

A couple of things:

\- what will you base the decisions on? You need a legal basis for most decisions.

\- your judicial system is heavily politicised AND you elect your judges. How long will it take for corporations to ~~bribe~~ donate to your judges?

\- where would you sort out family issues, then? Custody, parental rights, filiation are not matters on which people agree easily.

&gt; Trump has been a Democrat his entire life.  He supported the Clintons  and gave them money.  Everyone calls him such a liar until you point  this out, but NOW he's suddenly telling the truth. 

And that tells you something about the Dems starting from the 80s: they are just as much corporate shills as the Republicans have become. The only difference between mainstream Dems and Republicans these days is that Dems are just a bit less terrible on social issues. They are both big fans of corporate welfare and corporate authoritarianism.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; In fact, so far, he's killed the least amount of people overseas than any president in a while.  

[That is highly debatable](https://theintercept.com/2019/10/02/trump-impeachment-civilian-casualties-war/). Why do you think [he stopped reporting the number of victims of drone strikes](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47480207)? Certainly not because they kill less (and I do not think you are that naive.). [He did more drone strikes in Yemen in 2 years than Obama in 8 years and the trend holds for other places as well](https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2019/5/8/18619206/under-donald-trump-drone-strikes-far-exceed-obama-s-numbers). Now, do not misunderstand me. Obama's record is terrible. Trump's is just not any better.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; You'll note the ONE time our press praised him was during the early  bombing in Syria.  Turned on a dime and then back again.  Funny that  corporate-owned media with connections to the defense industry would  suddenly do that!  What a shock! 

No, that is exactly the same thing as they do with government.

$40 billion a year, that's roughly $1.3 billion dollars in sales.  And considering the growth in the market is only one or two percent, that would be a great way to jazz the books of the corporations for a few quarters.  ""Look at the growth, boss!""

That took all of 30 seconds to Google.

""And as far as I can see...""

Well, much like the people who argue with their 8th grade education in U.S. history, you don't know what you're talking about.  The Civil War was incredibly complex.  And while slavery WAS a major factor in the War, the North was not full of abolitionists.  Lincoln himself was pretty racist, but he was in the pocket of Northern Industrial interests who wanted to end slavery because they couldn't compete with free labor.  Hate to burst your bubble.  If you tore down statues of everyone that held racists views in the past, you'd pretty much have to tear down all statues.

Oh, but I'm sure YOU'RE motives are pure and lily white and there's nothing you've EVER done that would raise an eyebrow.  It's obvious why you're so eminently qualified to judge.  I'm sure your virtual signally on Facebook is just stellar, Karen.

""And one of the rights in society is to not get insulted out of the blue.""

No it isn't, dumbass.  See how that works?  Don't come crying to me when your politicians and lawyers stretch that definition to mean anything that criticizes them.  But at least you won't have to hear naughty words on your poor ears.

""A couple of things:""

Super complicated area here.  Just don't have the time to drill down.  Not all our judges are elected.  It varies from state to state and county by county in some cases.  But if they are elected, they can be removed.  The system of government is supposed to be a balance of the three branches, so while you could have crooked judges, you can appeal and there's only so many courts you can buy before people notice and then you're really in trouble.

""Quite the contrary...""

Well, while there are plenty of people that work in government that try to do their best, there are plenty that phone it in.  When you phone it in at a regular job, you're really only hurting yourself or a company.  When you phone it in at the State level, you're hurting everyone.

Fewer bureaucrats, I say.

That would be significant if one or two companies could get all the business from the exit of these local dairies. Divided by the number of companies ([well over 100, and only counting those big enough to register on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dairy_product_companies_in_the_United_States)). This will make a few millions, tens of millions at best. This will barely be a blip on the radar. Even more so, since most of the market will be cornered by major corporations like Danone, for which a few millions is not even an afterthought.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If you tore down statues of everyone that held racists views in the past, you'd pretty much have to tear down all statues.

There is a difference between people who held racist views and people with racist views who actually went to war to defend slavery. One is collateral, the other is the main point.

Also, I love to see all these supposedly freedom-loving Americans getting nostalgic over slavers. Seems like they only like freedom when it is their own and/or black and brown people do not get the same freedom.

By the way, nothing you said detracts from my point on this: all the times US citizens pressured the US government into doing something or abstaining from something, were achieved by peaceful protests, with no gun as support ot the claim. The Second amendment is a dead branch in your Constitution, something that outlived its usefulness and now has more adverse effects than advantages.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;No it isn't, dumbass.  See how that works?

Couple of things:

\- public insults is considered a misdemeanour in most of European continental law;

\- even in the US, insulting certain people or insulting anybody in certain settings will get you at least fined (courthouse, local political institutions...);

\- finally, by the same token, you should be fine with doxxing, slandering, defamation and threats, then, right? Orwell was a smart man, but he was no legal scholar. That shows, here. No freedom is absolute. Shout fire in a theater and see how that goes. That is not covered by freedom of speech. Neither are threats, or attacks on a person's honour, unless you can prove that you are right (and even then, there might be damages.).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Super complicated area here.  Just don't have the time to drill down.

You drilled down on dairy, but you won't on judicial reform. Oddly enough, the latter seems somewhat more important than the former, which gives a rather amusing view of your priorities.

&gt;The system of government is supposed to be a balance of the three  branches, so while you could have crooked judges, you can appeal and  there's only so many courts you can buy before people notice and then  you're really in trouble.

Who is dealing in fantasies, now? Your Supreme Court is stacked with corporate stooges. What has been done about them? Since Citizens United, the corporate shills have been tearing down your electoral system. I am still waiting to see the armed patriots you seem to so admire, on the steps of the Supreme Court, demanding that the corporate takeover ceases...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;When you phone it in at a regular job, you're really only hurting  yourself or a company.  When you phone it in at the State level, you're  hurting everyone.

Above a certain size, companies do not give a shit if certain employees ""phone it in"", as you say. Hel, if they did, they would fire a number of feckless execs, like the morons who pushed for stock buybacks, instead ofpreparing reserves for hard times.

As for civil servants not doing their job, I agree that there should be controls in place. That is usually the case, when recruiting (in a lot of European countries, you have competitions for recruiting civil servants, in order to weed out the less motivated and unqualified.) and during the career (I have objectives to fulfil every year. If I were to miss them twice in a row, my pay would be cut and if the trend continued, I would be fired.).

&amp;#x200B;

You will find less obvious bigotry among Dems, I would say. They are still corporate shills, with a terrible establishment.

Inciting war with Iran, despite Iran conforming to the agreement that had been previously signed, before the US ripped it up?

As for Afghanistan, cue the talibans getting back their power in 3, 2, 1... And another country will be under the thumb of islamists. I thought we were supposed to fight those?

How many of those companies can afford to lobby Congress, not many.  Additionally, you're also forgetting about their resources: land, cows, equipment and people they would acquire along the way.  I've met corporate guys that would sell their own mother for a .01% in a quarter.

Not that I would expect a bureaucrat to understand profit margins.

""There is a difference between people who held racist views and people with racist views who actually went to war to defend slavery.""

That's not why they went to war.  It was about MONEY, as it always.  Slavery just happened to be a factor in that calculation.  Those northerners did not embrace the freed slaves and invite them to move into their neighborhoods.  Lincoln RAN on a platform of NOT freeing slaves.  He had a plan to deport the freed slaves to Liberia in Africa, knowing they'd probably all die of malaria, which was pretty rampant there at the time.

You pointed out in the last thread Orwell was racist.  You plan on staging a protest at the BBC to tear down his quote?

""Couple of things:

Oof.  Sucks to be you guys.

""- even in the US, insulting certain people or insulting anybody in certain settings will get you at least fined (courthouse, local political institutions...);""

You're conflating court proceedings with public behavior.  In a U.S. courtroom, the judge is in charge.  That's different during a trial.  There's an order to it.  You can't just shout things out in a trial.

""finally...""

No one said you're free from the consequences of your actions if you shout ""fire"".  You wouldn't be charged if you did that, you'd be charge if someone got physically hurt as a direct result.  Do I honestly have to explain the difference between free speech, slander and libel?  Most insults aren't either and they're nearly impossible to prove when they are.

""You drilled down on dairy...""

Dairy is a relatively easy example with fewer players.  The judicial system is a complex maze of add-ons.  In a nutshell: follow the Constitution, legalize drugs and prostitution, abandon mandatory prison sentences and there's a bunch of laws that need to go that are completely unconstitutional.  Like no bail and redundant charges.

""Who is dealing in fantasies, now?...""

Well, you, I guess, because the electoral system is fine.  Right now, the DNC is trying to get everyone to can it in favor of the popular vote because they're in such a bad spot now.  Fortunately, it's holding just fine.  Oh and, there was this:  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52496514

Simply not true.  But it can be a war of attrition that takes a long time.  Before Wal Mart, there was K-Mart.  Still around, but not what it was.  McDonald's getting creamed by more gourmet burger joints.  7-Eleven got smashed by Wawa.  The wheel turns...

Perhaps your bureaucrats are different (though I doubt it), but ones in the U.S. have such strong unions it's almost impossible to fire them.  It's why our teachers and cops aren't so great either.

""You will find less obvious bigotry among Dems, I would say. They are still corporate shills, with a terrible establishment.""

Oof.  You DO NOT know what you're talking about.  The Republicans freed the slaves and the Democrats were the party of hardcore racists, especially down South, for decades.  The current Governor of Virginia was exposed for wearing blackface in a yearbook.

Again, the Democrats have most of our media on their side.  Typically, it's helped them out of many jams.  These days, they've destroyed their credibility badly.  CNN can't get a million viewers on their shows anymore.

The Left side of politics in the U.S. got romanticized in the 60's and those hippie kids grew up and many went into the media biz.  It got portrayed like things do on TV; Bad guy vs. good guy.

Now the Dems are starting to have the same problems at the Labour party in the UK: their high profile members making anti-semetic comments.  Meanwhile, Trump flew the Pride flag at the RNC and put that issue to rest in the GOP.  Things are different now.  They'll  be different again in the future.

""France participated, likely because Sarkozy, the French president at the time, had apparently been financed by Gaddafi during his election bid.""

Yeah, and Italy and France, I think, wanted the oil.  Now Libya has open slave markets again.  Goddamn mess.

""And Trump, instead of reversing them, takes advantage of them. Obama was terrible, Trump is doing rather worse.""

Yes and no.  While he is taking advantage, his targeted approach is a much more effective use of that power.  He has avoided war with Iran multiple times and continues to push for an Afghanistan withdrawal.  I'll believe he'll get it when they reorient the guns toward China.

Only Washington himself gave power.  I said Trump was better, he ain't a saint.  Although he did give the drone strike power back to the Pentagon officially.  Obama had the Matrix, Trump lets the generals do it, which is only a marginal improvement since he orders the generals.

""Promoting peace?...""
North Korea tore down the guard towers and cleared the mines.  Basically, Trump just kept the U.S. out of the way so the two countries could talk.  Big improvement over previous administration.

The Taliban peace deal is done, now they're trying to calm things down.  It seems to be in a constant state of nearly blowing up again, but it is signed.  Trump reportedly pushed to get the soldiers out because of the virus.

He genuinely wanted peace with the Russians, which is classic Trump.  Align with the big dog, take over everyone else and then take out the big dog.  Unfortunately, the Dems had this ridiculous plan to impeach him.  Look for that in the second term.

He's had multiple opportunities to crush Iran and didn't.  I don't agree with his tactics, but if you're going to play this game, at least he's playing to win.  After re-election, there's a good chance the Iranians do not want to go another four years doing this dance.

As for Yemen, unfortunately, there's no support for Yemen here but things seemed to have cooled somewhat.  The Saudis are a tough nut to crack.  Again, Nixon, tied our damn currency to their oil.  Probably the final chess move, if he can get around to it.  The problem is, they are happy to play ball and they have deep, deep pockets.  Until the Saudis run out of oil and tank their economy, no one is going to touch them, so I'm not sure what you expect anyone to do.  I mean, shit, the U.N. let them run the Human Rights Council for Christ's sake.  The Saudis have marginally improved since they modernized, but not much.

You do not have to explain it to me, but apparently, you would have to explain it to Orwell, since the quote you trotted out does not make a difference. That's the problem with soundbites: they do not make for a nuanced reflection like these issues demand.

Yep, dealing in fantasies...

Without even getting into the mess that is your Constitution (because a lot of it is customary or derived, so that will be a challenge to implement).

I would argue that bail itself is actually aarguably inconstitutional, because it creates a disparity between citizens (those with money and those without). The whole idea of bail is to prevent flights; Who do you think is more at risk of fleeing? The rich guy or the poor one? Then, who do you think will be able to make bail? The rich guy or the poor guy? The system is skewed in favour of moneyed arseholes and your reforms would only serve to compound the issue.

Legalising drugs? Why not, I guess some of them are much less harmful than touted. All of them? Now, you are opening a nasty can of worm. You will need heavy regulations to avoid abuse (regulations you do not want to have, by the way), as evidenced by the opioid overdoses epidemic.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Well, you, I guess, because the electoral system is fine. 

Is it, though? Gerrymandering, disenfranchisement, voter purge are all prevalent in your system. Both parties engage in it, but the Republicans seem to really be enthusiastic about those, by the way. You want voter ID? Fine, but you will have to give personal information to the State. Do you really want to do that, if you are worried of them exploiting said information? Small government and rigorous control of citizens do not work together.

&gt; Perhaps your bureaucrats are different (though I doubt it), but ones in  the U.S. have such strong unions it's almost impossible to fire them.   It's why our teachers and cops aren't so great either. 

We have strong unions in the public sector, but depending on the country, they are more or less obstructive. Unions in Germany are usually pretty constructive, while the ones in France are much less so, be they for the private or public sector. I would say it comes down to the local culture.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;An April study about the [effects of coronavirus media coverage](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/2020-44/)  analyzed two popular Fox News cable programs — and claims how one host  talked about the threat of the coronavirus resulted in greater numbers  of COVID-19 cases and deaths.

&gt;Researchers at the Becker Friedman  Institute for Economics at University of Chicago took a deep dive into  those implications in the working paper “Misinformation During a  Pandemic,” in which they examined the audience that watched *Hannity* versus *Tucker Carlson Tonight*.

&gt;Right-wing  Fox News is the most watched cable network in the U.S., and half of its  audience is over the age of 65. Many of its television shows and  personalities downplayed the threat of the novel coronavirus and thus [received harsh criticism](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/business/coronavirus-fox-news-lachlan-murdoch.html) for ignoring a public health crisis.

&gt;The  economists examined scripts from shows and studied how differential  exposure to the two shows affected behavior and health outcomes.  Conservative hosts Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson support President  Donald Trump, and they are at the helm of the two, most-widely viewed  cable news shows in the U.S. But they took different broadcasting paths  when the coronavirus first hit the U.S.

&gt;The paper notes that  Carlson was an outlier on Fox and, as early as Jan. 28, spent a chunk of  his show discussing the dangers of a global pandemic. He continued to  warn of deadly consequences.

&gt;On Feb. 25, according to the paper,  Carlson warned viewers of the potential impact the outbreak could have  in the U.S. “Currently, the coronavirus appears to kill about 2% of the  people who have it. So let's be generous for a moment and imagine that  asymptomatic carriers are not detected and the real death rate is only  say half a percent — that would be one quarter of the current estimates.  Even under that scenario, there would still be 27 million deaths from  coronavirus globally. In this country, more than a million would die,”  Carlson said.

&gt;Meanwhile, Hannity downplayed coronavirus as just  the flu and emphasized that Democrats were politicizing the virus to  undermine Trump.

&gt;“And today, thankfully, zero people in the United  States of America have died from the coronavirus. Zero. Now, let's put  this in perspective. In 2017, 61,000 people in this country died from  influenza, the flu. Common flu. Around 100 people die every single day  from car wrecks,” the paper quotes Hannity from his show on Feb. 27.

&gt;By  mid-March the host changed his posture and began to broadcast CDC  guidelines, according to the paper. “If you feel sick, stay at home. If  your kids feel sick, don't send them to school or day care. If someone  in your household has tested positive for coronavirus, please  self-quarantine your entire household. Keep them at home,” Hannity told  his viewers.

1294,trump,"I don’t think any president is the “best” authority to be dealing with this. This is a medical issue and Trump actually has good medical advisors. At the same time, we have the economic impact, which Trump has a slightly better frame of reference. It’s finding the balance between any deaths are “too many” and “the cure can’t be worse than the disease”. I really don’t have an answer. Opening up every state is likely to cause an explosion of cases and death, and at the same time, we can’t live on unemployment, eating fast food and buying all of our things at Walmart and from Amazon. Hypothesizing Trump doesn’t get re-elected, what would the next president do to make this all better? The states and regions within the states are so diverse, it’s impossible to think the current “one size fits all” approaches are sustainable much longer, but how do you reopen some places without just shifting outbreak hotspots? Trump is sticking his toes in Defense Production Act declarations, but it’s definitely not being taken well by all sides. Orange man bad is certainly being a fascist by trying to control private industry, but I can assure you that the public will be rioting when we have no meat and produce in the stores for two months. The federal government can prop up industry for a while, but there’s still the factions that aren’t in support of seeing another trillion dollars of national debt. There’s almost no possibility of anyone winning in this situation for the long term, only losers and bigger losers. America as a whole has very much tiptoed into measures to fight “the virus”, while we still don’t even know the actual effects of the virus. Maybe social distancing and other tactics have been really effective? Maybe it’s not that big of a deal and our efforts have been futile while we’ve completely destroyed our economy for the near term? It’s almost impossible to know either way.",1,1588353480

Oy.  This discussion is rapidly collapsing into your moral position and how superior you think you are to people. We all agree slavery is bad.  Even a racist can believe it's bad, albeit for slightly different reasons.  You did some moral grandstanding about statues and here we are, discussing the metric of which racists (by modern standards) should keep their statues.  You could win the argument without using your feelings and your moral judgment, so the debate keeps shifting to areas where your sense of moral outrage can win.

Things that are historical are connected to people who, in a modern context, would be considered horrible people.  That's not why these statues and monuments were built, they were about history.  And as any sane person would acknowledge, those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it.  So can we stop going down this path before you're forced to somehow wedge Hitler into this discussion?

On bail:  

Bail is set according to the crime and the individual.  It can literally be set at any number, so it can be adjusted either way by the judge.  The system of bail is, therefore, not discriminatory.  Judges can be unfair or stupid or make bad decisions.

On drugs...

Again the bureaucrat wants regulations.  We have those common sense laws that everyone agrees.  No kids should gain access, ingredients and effects should be known and listed.  Beyond that, if you believe a woman should be able to have an abortion because she has the right to decide what to do with her body, why wouldn't that logic apply to drugs?

""Is it, though?...""

Please stop making me defend the GOP.  No post modernist, just because a system has problems, doesn't mean you scrap the whole system!  All the things you listed, Democrats do.  You know how I know?  Because they invented most of those tactics back when the GOP was new and progressive.  (Again, see Lincoln.)  These days, it's a complicated dance between two factions that use every legal means to beat the other.

Then every once in a while a transformative figure emerges.  Then suddenly, everything changes.  In the UK, Jeremy Corbyn led Labour to disaster with his commie friends and identity politics.  Here, it's the other side, Trump has led the GOP back to the center and away from hard right religious moralism.  While Trump offers a big tent, the Democrats are too busy canceling each other and offering purity tests that no one can pass.

Seriously, don't watch our media.  Most of them will tell you the exact opposite.

Like most people, I thought Trump was going to get smashed in 2016.  Then about a week before the election, I took a trip to western Pennsylvania. It was a sea of Trump signs everywhere.  I realized things were different outside my bubble, but this was proof.  A two hour ride and everything outside of Philly said ""Trump/Pence"".

""I know enough to have heard of the Southern Strategy....""

That some people are better than others?  No thanks.  I'll pass on elitism thanks.

""Corporate shills...""

I'm a Libertarian.  I'm outside most of this tribalism.  People in this country mostly vote against their least preferred candidate and they also think third parties are a waste of vote.   And the majority don't vote at all.

""Did that, though?...""

Newsflash: European is anti-religion!  While there are still members of the GOP that make noise about old issues, being gay is a non-issue.  They are keeping that belief within their religious circles now.

The Koreas will unite.  When they do, the South will quickly rule things.

Once the U.S. leaves, the focus will probably be on China.  I doubt you'll hear word one in our media.

Trump is many things, but he is NEVER without a plan.  Whether that plan is on-the-spot or mapped out weeks in advance differs, but he has show time and time again he knows how to circumvent things.  No to mention all the things that must be going on behind the scenes.  The mind boggles.

on Iran

In the U.S., wars work like this: You have to get the general public on board, demonize the opposition and then justify why we're in another mess.  Those opportunities has happened multiple times, but Trump just held back.

The Saudis...

That the Saudis are on the council at all!  Jesus, their human rights record has been terrible!  And they have an inordinate amount of power because they're supplying the world with oil.  

The Kashoggi thing?  That's what monarchies do.  Anything the king says.  That's not gonna change until their government changes.  I'm sure there's a lot more people they killed we don't know about.  Hell, they just stopped capital punishment for minors!  Babysteps.",1,1588361968

Sure. You have to remember history. However, statues are built to honour those to whom they are dedicated. These statues glorify, not the oppressed, but the oppressors. How many statues honouring the memories of slaves do you have in the Southern States? How many of people who defended slavery? When your main call to fame is that you defended slavery, maybe you should not be honoured, lest the wrong lesson be drawn...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The system of bail is, therefore, not discriminatory.  Judges can be unfair or stupid or make bad decisions. 

The system of bail is self-defeating. If you impose bail on somebody, it is because the person is a flight risk. If that is the case, then you need to keep the person at hand anyway. The whole bail system is simply asking for trouble.

What is more, poor people simply cannot afford any sort of bail. So, yes, it is discriminatory. It impacts black and brown people disproportionately, but it also impacts poor white people. This is not a discrimination based on race, it is a discrimination based on money and social class.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  We have those common sense laws that everyone agrees.  No kids should  gain access, ingredients and effects should be known and listed.   

And you get an opioid overdose epidemic, because common sense is never enough once greed gets involved. Corporations have been pushing their shit on doctors and patients. Where is their responsibility? They might pay millions, but they made billions out of, essentially, killing people. Now, tell me how that incentivises them to stop them pushing drugs  they know are nowhere near as safe as they make them out to be?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Beyond that, if you believe a woman should be able to have an abortion  because she has the right to decide what to do with her body, why  wouldn't that logic apply to drugs? 

Sure. As long as [you do not market said drugs as without risk or as a miracle drug](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2622774/), as said companies have done. The ones who pushed for this kind of misrepresentation will be shielded from any consequences by the company, which will anyway come out on top, because even with the damages, they will have made billions out of all of this, while people were dying because of their blatant disregard for safety and truth.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  No post modernist, just because a system has problems, doesn't mean you scrap the whole system! 

Sure, but when the problems go from the roots to the treetop, maybe it is time to think about how to actually change it...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; In the UK, Jeremy Corbyn led Labour to disaster with his commie friends and identity politics. 

Corbyn, communist? Did he advocate for nationalising the means of production? Expropriating any farmer, any factory owner? Having the workers seize complete control of said means of production? No? Then he is no communist.

It gets tiring to explain that just because a politician is left of neoliberalism it does not make him a communist. Your Overton window has slipped so far to the right that you have lost sight of any possible distinction to the left. And you have had ""left bad"" drilled into your heads all your life, while the right captured the political discourse and screwed up the system for all involved.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Like most people, I thought Trump was going to get smashed in 2016.   

I thought he had a shot. I would have loved to be wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; That some people are better than others?  No thanks.  I'll pass on elitism thanks. 

What elitism? Is it so difficult to agree that, yes, racists are bad and that trying to capture their vote by appealing to their racism is a bad thing?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Newsflash: European is anti-religion!  

We have slaughtered each other for centuries about religious bullshit. At long last, the lesson had begun to stick. And then religious dumbasses thought that they would once again rekindle that shit, from islamists to traditional catholics, through evangelists. So, yes, I am somewhat pissed that some people will kill others over fairy tales. All because arseholes in the Middle East could not keep their social control boner in check.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; While there are still members of the GOP that make noise about old  issues, being gay is a non-issue.  They are keeping that belief within  their religious circles now. 

Then why is Trump making such a big fuss about the whole Thanksgiving/Christmas/holidays if nobody cares? Why did he push for that ""religious freedom"" tripe to be passed as law? Who does that benefit if not the evangelicals?

First you tell me that they do not have issues with gays, and now your point is that they are keeping it to themselves. Newsflash: [no, they are not](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/06/28/anti-gay-hate-crimes-rise-fbi-says-and-they-likely-undercount/1582614001/). And they are pushing for [legislation affecting LGBT people just about everywhere](https://www.aclu.org/legislation-affecting-lgbt-rights-across-country).

&gt; The Koreas will unite.  When they do, the South will quickly rule things. 

Agreed, if the Kims do not go completely off the rails before that and chuck a missile where they should not.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Trump is many things, but he is NEVER without a plan.  Whether that plan  is on-the-spot or mapped out weeks in advance differs, but he has show  time and time again he knows how to circumvent things. 

A guy who manages to sink a casino and goes bankrupt six times does not have a plan. He might be good at getting his own arse out of the fire, but he has no plan.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Those opportunities has happened multiple times, but Trump just held back. 

I would argue that you will not be able to get the public on board anyway. You still have troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, people tend to remember that. And no matter how much warmongering you do (and your media is gung-ho about war), people still remember the vets and the dead they have around their, in their families and communities.

My take on this is that Trump is bumbling his way through this, but he does feel that his base will not follow him if he opens up another front. Right now, he can deflect the blame for maintaining the troops abroad on Bush and Obama (and rather rightfully so), but I think it would be a bridge too far, even for his supporters, to launch another war.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; That the Saudis are on the council at all!  Jesus, their human rights record has been terrible! 

Yes, it is. Problem is, seats on that Council are allocated by region. Which means that there were some seats just for the Middle East. Now, find me one country in this region with a good or even acceptable track record on human rights. The Saudis are a major player, so of course, they would get votes from other countries in the region.

The UN is an international organisation. They cannot exclude regions or states from any instance, just like the US cannot exclude States from its federal apparatus, just because it is convenient.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The Kashoggi thing?  That's what monarchies do.  Anything the king says. 

No. The UK, Spain, Denmark, Norway are monarchies. The monarch does not order citizens to get butchered and flushed down the sewers. What you describe is the sign of an absolute (also theocratic, but that is somewhat irrelevant here) monarchy.",1,1588400334
1304,trump,"""...remember history...""

Jesus, you're obsessed.  Just determined to wipe it all out and start clean, eh post modernist?  I shouldn't be surprised coming from a European bureaucrat.  No one looks at these statues and says to themselves, ""Gee!  Slavery must've been swell!""  History does not adhere to your perfect vision of what everyone should learn and in fact, it should not.  The world is not divided up into oppressors and oppressed.  I know you like to imagine we're full of soft-brained fatties over here, but I've traveled to the South many times.  It's suburban.  No fat racists in overalls playing banjos, just IT engineers and soccer moms mostly.

""Bail..."" 

Again, you can adjust it for a poor person.  The idea is to keep them from being a flight risk.  Poor people go to bail bondsman, where you only need 10%.  It depends on the judge, the jail, etc.  The problem is, the new rule allows the judge to assess you get NO bail, so you have no chance of getting out until you're cleared.  It's only discriminatory if the judge is.

""And you get an opioid overdose epidemic...""

Yeah, like the alcoholic epidemic when the legalized booze again.  Oh, wait...

I told you, the problem with the judicial system is the caps put on awards by Congress via regulating industry.  Remove the caps and you put people out of business.  BP had it's liability capped at $100 million during the oil spill, which is why they were willing to risk such a spill in the first place.  Regulation bad!

Part of the problem is this:  If you have a government that says, ""Don't worry, we have regulations to protect you.""  You get a populace that ASSUMES there's no risk.  For instance, in the U.S. people used to keep tabs on their bank.  They would be wary of putting their money in the bank because if it failed, you'd lose your money.  Then the FDIC was created to insure money up to $100K, now it's higher, $250K.  Sounds great, right?

The problem is, once you do that, none of the customers cared what the bank did.  And part of the problem with the banks is that they take wild chances on risky investment schemes with their customer's money.  But the customers don't care because they know they cannot lose their meager savings, so NO ONE checks on the bank, save the regulators, who are bad at it and can't be everywhere.

The same logic applies to drugs, food, etc.  People are no longer wary, they are entitled little bitches who throw a fit wherever they go.  It's part of the reason no one listened to me back in January when I told them to start wearing a mask.  The news told them they'd be fine and like the sheep they are, they believed it.  

You don't want people to die but to micromanage every aspect of industry is too much.  Yes, you go after the big dogs who hurt people, but there should be a healthy amount of chaos in the mix.  You should get your hand a little burned so you know not to touch the stove.

""Corbyn, communist?...""
https://i0.wp.com/www.creativededuction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/corbyn-commie.jpg?w=1280

Here's the problem with Socialists, they think it stops.  Even Marx (or one of the commie founding fathers) admitted Socialism was just a slow roll to Communism and it is.  

See, socialism doesn't work.  The moment you start putting on price controls and labor controls, you distort the marketplace until you drive people out of business. Now it's possible that the government will let up before it happens, prolonging things and hovering in stasis, between capitalism and socialism for a time.  But when you get as far along, as say Venezuela, things collapse and you're forced to nationalize everything or give up power.  

In socialism, there's no problem the government won't attempt to solve.  None.  And it just keeps accumulating tasks that it gets worse and worse at fixing until it breaks the government.  All the while, people keep lowering and lowering their expectations as they get poorer and poorer.

So Corbyn wouldn't START at Communism.  He starts with guaranteed housing and full unemployment, which he can't achieve without ridiculous amounts of power and then you quickly snowball into Communism because you ""have"" to.

Fortunately, Corbyn's been humiliated.  It was hilarious to watch.  Go UK!

""What elitism?...""

Racism is bad.  Being racist is bad, but it's not a permanent condition.  Ask Daryl Davis. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_Davis

""Religion..""

Well, I'm not religious, but I think it's possible to be a religious person without being an asshole.  Separation of church and state and all...

""Then why is Trump...""

You don't understand the politics here.  You definitely don't understand Trump.  When you're a Republican, you do Republican things.  Just like when you're a Democrat, you do Democrat things.  In the GOP, you go to church and you acknowledge all the big holidays.  You say, ""God Bless the United States of America"".  When you're a Democrat, you visit ever marginalized group and make sure your staff is a rainbow of diversity.  It's all a show.

What you also have to understand is how every marginalized group in this country has it's own political organization.  Now most of these sprang out of the era of the Civil Rights Movement and the time right after.  And for decades, the won battles and they did some good.  But in 2020, they face a real problem...

People in the U.S. are way more tolerant now.  They just are.  I told you, you can't listen to our media.  (USA Today?  Seriously?)  ACLU aren't the crusading guys they once were.  In the past, they were on the left and that was okay because all the progressive were there.  Their fights were righteous and they did great things.

The problem now?  Over the last 20 years the lines have blurred.  The GOP is not jam packed full of rich, white racists.  They were under the gun from these groups for so many years and as the TV and Internet made scandals more instant, they simply purged everyone that had those scandals.

But the Democrats didn't do that.  They weren't under the same scrutiny.  The media is on THEIR side.  So guys like Robert Byrd https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd 
get the benefit of the doubt.  They're allowed to make amends.  They get a pass for their past.  While if the members of the GOP make so much as misspeak---  It's a huge scandal, blown up by the media to get rid of one those nasty Republicans.  After a time, the Republicans just kept purging until now, the Democrats have more problems.  The current Governor of Virginia caught in blackface in high school.  No way a Republican could survive that.  The media would howl until he was gone.  Because he's a Democrat, he's still in office.  Kavanaugh, gets called a gang rapist while the media gets to wildly speculate.  Biden, despite witness confirmation, his history of oddly touching people and his own hypocrisy---  The media is tripping all over itself to say there should be proof.

That double standard is real.  But the BIG problem is, the Democrats would always run on two things: helping the working man and ending discrimination.  Helping the working man went out the window when they outsourced most of the factory job to China in the early 90's.  It officially ended when Hillary ran in 2016 and she blew off major dinners with groups connected to workers.  (Despite her husband's warnings.)  The Democrats are now the party of Goldman Sachs.

As for discrimination?  It's mostly gone.  Companies are petrified of getting caught up in a lawsuit.  The incidents you see in our media are so obscure and so far afield, you have to dig deep to find them now.  (50 years ago, not the case)  What we have is an uptick in FAKE racist and homophobic attacks.  What we have is a moral panic where people see that stuff everywhere.  Like when Sarah Silverman took pictures of ""nazi symbols"" and posted them online, only to find out they were just markings for the construction workers who were fixing sewer pipes in her neighborhood.

So, circling back---  Groups like the ADL, ACLU and many others---  They're hurting for donors because they've simply outlived their usefulness OR they cannot straddle the political divide.  Their default are the Democrats, even as they destroy themselves.  Even as their own members make antisemetic comments, which has happened in the Women's March, from Ilhan Omar and most recently, Mayor DeBlasio.  Coming from a Republican?  That ends a career.  Coming from these people, the most charitable explanation is always given.

I'm not saying there is no racism in America, but what I am saying is what you hear in our media is wildly out of proportion to what actually happens.  Racial events are big ratings for the media.  They have milked them and fanned the flames to keep them going.  They are doing that with the COVID-19 response right now.  When the positive cases finally plateaued and started going down, they immediately shifted to the death totals, because of the two week incubation period, they are still going up.  ""Death toll climbs!"" are the headlines, despite the fact hospitalization and new cases are going down, down, down.",1,1588407261

""A guy who manages to sink a casino...""

Bankruptcy is just a business ploy these days.  It's the end of a process for most of these guys that squeeze businesses for all their cash.  They are totally planned.

""I would argue that you will not be able to get the public on board anyway...""

Would love to agree with you, but again, our media has no problem lying.  They told us the Iraqis had mobile Anthrax labs and drones capable of spraying the U.S. countryside.  People freaked out and went to Home Depot to buy masking tape and plastic tarps to cover their windows.  And that was BEFORE 9/11.

What's stopping the Iran War is Trump.  He's trying to get us out of the Middle East.  He's simply not in bed with the Defense Contractors like Cheney.  He's not altruistic, he can see there's no real monetary reason to be there.  We don't need the oil and the overhead on maintaining all the bases is insane.

By the way, he has a 95% approval rate amongst Republicans.  That's legendary loyalty.  People came out to vote for him in this primary in record numbers and they didn't have to, they just wanted to.

The Saudis are an absolute monarchy.  They always have been is my understanding.  The UK is a constitutional monarchy.  The Queen's role is mostly as a figurehead.  Hardly the same.  She can't kill anyone.",1,1588407875
1306,trump,"&gt; Bankruptcy is just a business ploy these days. 

And that is how they escape liability. As I have said, privatising the gains, cosialising the costs.

&gt; Would love to agree with you, but again, our media has no problem lying.   They told us the Iraqis had mobile Anthrax labs and drones capable of  spraying the U.S. countryside. 

I would argue the lie came from Bush and his cronies and that the media took it up because it was good for ratings... Funnily enough, that story was recycled from what the Japanese were trying during WWII (with balloons instead of drones). That went as well as expected.

[By sending more troops to the Middle East](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2020-01-03/trump-to-send-3-000-more-troops-to-middle-east-amid-iran-escalation)? Sounds contradictory.

Indeed, this is what I said. There is a distinction between monarchy (as you wrote) and absolute monarchy. The Sauds are propped up by the religious apparatus. Another reason why religion interfering in public affairs is poisonous.",1,1588413563
1307,trump,But Susan Collins assured us he'd learned his lesson! What more do you want from a group of people whose sole purpose was to appoint as many Federalist Society judges while Trump is in office?,1,1588431520
1308,trump,"Rebel against what?  There aren't a lot of intersections between the average person and that level of governance, and those intersections tend to be reasonable.

Believe me, I've looked for ways to confront this animal Trump that would benefit society.  What I've found is that he's not much more than an internet meme.",1,1588432672
1309,trump,Lol did you just cite the constitution?  We don’t use that here anymore.  It may as well say “Donald Trump is a cunt and can never be president” for all it would matter.  Term limits are going to be a thing of the past soon!  Elections too.  Don’t need that crap getting in the way of the semi-free market.,1,1588433799
1310,trump,"At this point, 'No collusion!' is just a Trump rally cry. Kinda like  'you will not replace us' and ['blood and soil'](https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/12/us/charlottesville-unite-the-right-rally/index.html).",1,1588434204
